"Dakwaan Kerajaan Akan Keluarkan Lesen Operasi Kasino Di Forest City, Johor Adalah Tidak","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a ‚Äúfiscal conservative‚Äù on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace the Nation,‚Äù drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. ‚ÄúThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,‚Äô‚Äù Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. ‚ÄúNow, Democrats are saying that‚Äôs not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don‚Äôt see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people‚Äôs money,‚Äù he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party‚Äôs debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,‚Äù Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. ‚ÄúThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we‚Äôve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we‚Äôre going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,‚Äù Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or ‚Äúentitlement reform,‚Äù as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan‚Äôs early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the ‚ÄúDreamers,‚Äù people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. ‚ÄúWe need to do DACA clean,‚Äù she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. ",REAL
Waspada Tawaran Tunai Haji Menggunakan Visa Oleh Pihak Ketiga ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration‚Äôs request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. ‚ÄúThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD‚Äôs study and will continue to defend the president‚Äôs lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,‚Äù the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: ‚ÄúAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.‚Äù Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal ‚Äúgreat news.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it‚Äôs not good for the military or our country,‚Äù Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military ‚Äúcannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.‚Äù Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump‚Äôs ban while legal challenges to the Republican president‚Äôs policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants‚Äô sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept ‚Äúsome individuals who are not medically fit for service.‚Äù The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump‚Äôs defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president‚Äôs ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

Penjelasan Berkenaan Laporan Berita Berkaitan Tidak Boleh Perbaharui Pasport Kerana Tidak Boleh Berbahasa,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump‚Äôs 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. ‚ÄúThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,‚Äù Graham said on CBS‚Äôs Face the Nation news program. ‚ÄúAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he‚Äôs the right guy at the right time.‚Äù  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump‚Äôs campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller‚Äôs team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was ‚Äúgoing to be fair.‚Äù    Russia‚Äôs role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI‚Äôs use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller‚Äôs inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  ‚ÄúI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,‚Äù Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. ‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,‚Äù he said. ",REAL
Makluman Kadar Kenaikan Gaji Penjawat Awam  Adalah Tidak Benar ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI‚Äôs decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow‚Äôs contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide‚Äôs campaign role, saying it was ‚Äúextremely limited‚Äù and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump‚Äôs first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump‚Äôs White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller‚Äôs team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller‚Äôs office declined to comment. Trump‚Äôs White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. ‚ÄúOut of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,‚Äù he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow. ",REAL
Waspada Panggilan Palsu Menggunakan Nama Kementerian Komunikasi ,"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge ‚Äúmuch more‚Äù to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     ‚ÄúWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!‚Äù Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president‚Äôs tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the ‚ÄúAmazon Washington Post‚Äù fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump‚Äôs comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. ‚ÄúWe do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,‚Äù he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers‚Äô doorsteps. Amazon‚Äôs No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump‚Äôs comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its ‚Äúproductive relationship‚Äù with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service‚Äôs methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump‚Äôs tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service‚Äôs revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. ",REAL
"Dakwaan Kerajaan Akan Keluarkan Lesen Operasi Kasino Di Forest City, Johor","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it was set to kick off talks next week with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on immigration policy, government spending and other issues that need to be wrapped up early in the new year. The expected flurry of legislative activity comes as Republicans and Democrats begin to set the stage for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump‚Äôs Republican Party is eager to maintain control of Congress while Democrats look for openings to wrest seats away in the Senate and the House of Representatives. On Wednesday, Trump‚Äôs budget chief Mick Mulvaney and legislative affairs director Marc Short will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan - both Republicans - and their Democratic counterparts, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the White House said. That will be followed up with a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump, McConnell and Ryan on Jan. 6 and 7 at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, according to the White House. The Senate returns to work on Jan. 3 and the House on Jan. 8. Congress passed a short-term government funding bill last week before taking its Christmas break, but needs to come to an agreement on defense spending and various domestic programs by Jan. 19, or the government will shut down. Also on the agenda for lawmakers is disaster aid for people hit by hurricanes in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, and by wildfires in California. The House passed an $81 billion package in December, which the Senate did not take up. The White House has asked for a smaller figure, $44 billion. Deadlines also loom for soon-to-expire protections for young adult immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, known as ‚ÄúDreamers.‚Äù In September, Trump ended Democratic former President Barack Obama‚Äôs Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected Dreamers from deportation and provided work permits, effective in March, giving Congress until then to devise a long-term solution. Democrats, some Republicans and a number of large companies have pushed for DACA protections to continue. Trump and other Republicans have said that will not happen without Congress approving broader immigration policy changes and tougher border security. Democrats oppose funding for a wall promised by Trump along the U.S.-Mexican border.  ‚ÄúThe Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc,‚Äù Trump said in a Twitter post on Friday. Trump wants to overhaul immigration rules for extended families and others seeking to live in the United States. Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent critic of the president, said he would work with Trump to protect Dreamers. ‚ÄúWe can fix DACA in a way that beefs up border security, stops chain migration for the DREAMers, and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery. If POTUS (Trump) wants to protect these kids, we want to help him keep that promise,‚Äù Flake wrote on Twitter. Congress in early 2018 also must raise the U.S. debt ceiling to avoid a government default. The U.S. Treasury would exhaust all of its borrowing options and run dry of cash to pay its bills by late March or early April if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before then, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Trump, who won his first major legislative victory with the passage of a major tax overhaul this month, has also promised a major infrastructure plan. ",REAL
Waspada Tawaran Tunai Haji Menggunakan Visa Oleh Pihak Ketiga ,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he believes he will be fairly treated in a special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, but said he did not know how long the probe would last. The federal investigation has hung over Trump‚Äôs White House since he took office almost a year ago, and some Trump allies have in recent weeks accused the team of Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being biased against the Republican president. But in an interview with the New York Times, Trump appeared to shrug off concerns about the investigation, which was prompted by U.S. intelligence agencies‚Äô conclusion that Russia tried to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no collusion. But I think he‚Äôs going to be fair,‚Äù Trump said in what the Times described as a 30-minute impromptu interview at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Mueller has charged four Trump associates in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said this month that he was not aware of any impropriety by Mueller‚Äôs team. Trump‚Äôs lawyers have been saying for weeks that they had expected the Mueller investigation to wrap up quickly, possibly by the end of 2017. Mueller has not commented on how long it will last. Trump told the Times that he did not know how long the investigation would take. ‚ÄúTiming-wise, I can‚Äôt tell you. I just don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. Trump said he thought a prolonged probe ‚Äúmakes the country look bad‚Äù but said it has energized his core supporters. ‚ÄúWhat it‚Äôs done is, it‚Äôs really angered the base and made the base stronger. My base is strong than it‚Äôs ever been,‚Äù he said. The interview was a rare break in Trump‚Äôs Christmas vacation in Florida. He has golfed each day aside from Christmas Day, and mainly kept a low profile, apart from the occasional flurry of tweets. He spent one day golfing with Republican Senator David Perdue from Georgia, who has pushed legislation to cap immigration numbers, and had dinner on Thursday with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, an international trade hawk. Trump told the Times he hoped to work with Democrats in the U.S. Congress on a spending plan to fix roads and other infrastructure, and on protections for a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Trump spoke about trade issues, saying he had backed off his hard line on Chinese trade practices in the hope that Beijing would do more to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile testing program. He said he had been disappointed in the results. He also complained about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which his administration is attempting to renegotiate in talks with Mexico and Canada. Trump said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had played down the importance of Canadian oil and lumber exports to the United States when looking at the balance of trade between the two countries. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt make the right deal, I‚Äôll terminate NAFTA in two seconds. But we‚Äôre doing pretty good,‚Äù Trump said. ",REAL

Waspada Produk Kingu Ginseng Candy Mengandungi Tadalafil ,"(Reuters) - Alabama officials on Thursday certified Democrat Doug Jones the winner of the state‚Äôs U.S. Senate race, after a state judge denied a challenge by Republican Roy Moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Jones won the vacant seat by about 22,000 votes, or 1.6 percentage points, election officials said. That made him the first Democrat in a quarter of a century to win a Senate seat in Alabama.  The seat was previously held by Republican Jeff Sessions, who was tapped by U.S. President Donald Trump as attorney general. A state canvassing board composed of Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, Governor Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall certified the election results. Seating Jones will narrow the Republican majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats. In a statement, Jones called his victory ‚Äúa new chapter‚Äù and pledged to work with both parties. Moore declined to concede defeat even after Trump urged him to do so. He stood by claims of a fraudulent election in a statement released after the certification and said he had no regrets, media outlets reported. An Alabama judge denied Moore‚Äôs request to block certification of the results of the Dec. 12 election in a decision shortly before the canvassing board met. Moore‚Äôs challenge alleged there had been potential voter fraud that denied him a chance of victory. His filing on Wednesday in the Montgomery Circuit Court sought to halt the meeting scheduled to ratify Jones‚Äô win on Thursday. Moore could ask for a recount, in addition to possible other court challenges, Merrill said in an interview with Fox News Channel. He would have to complete paperwork ‚Äúwithin a timed period‚Äù and show he has the money for a challenge, Merrill said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve not been notified yet of their intention to do that,‚Äù Merrill said. Regarding the claim of voter fraud, Merrill told CNN that more than 100 cases had been reported. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve adjudicated more than 60 of those. We will continue to do that,‚Äù he said.  Republican lawmakers in Washington had distanced themselves from Moore and called for him to drop out of the race after several women accused him of sexual assault or misconduct dating back to when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s.

Video Tular Merupakan Video Lama Latihan Simulasi Kesiapsiagaan Anggota Keselamatan Dengan,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new U.S. tax code targets high-tax states and may be unconstitutional, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday, saying that the bill may violate New York residents‚Äô rights to due process and equal protection.  The sweeping Republican tax bill signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday introduces a cap, of $10,000,  on deductions of state and local income and property taxes, known as SALT. The tax overhaul was the party‚Äôs first major legislative victory since Trump took office in January.  The SALT provision will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes, high property values and high taxes, like New York, New Jersey and California. Those states are generally Democratic leaning.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even sure what they did is legally constitutional and that‚Äôs something we‚Äôre looking at now,‚Äù Cuomo said in an interview with CNN. In an interview with CNBC, Cuomo suggested why the bill may be unconstitutional.  ‚ÄúPolitics does not trump the law,‚Äù Cuomo said on CNBC. ‚ÄúYou have the constitution, you have the law, you have due process, you have equal protection. You can‚Äôt use politics just because the majority controls to override the law.‚Äù The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, better known for its protection against self-incrimination, also protects individuals from seizure of life, liberty or property without due process and has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as guaranteeing equal protection by the law.  Cuomo and California Governor Jerry Brown, both Democrats, have previously said they were exploring legal challenges to SALT deduction limits.  Law professors have said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states‚Äô rights under the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs 10th Amendment. Tax attorneys said Cuomo‚Äôs legal argument against the tax bill could be that it discriminates and places an unjust tax burden on states that heavily voted for Democrats in the past - known as ‚Äúblue states.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe de facto effect of this legislation is to discriminate against blue states and particularly from (Cuomo‚Äôs) perspective the state of New York,‚Äù said Joseph Callahan, an attorney with the law firm Mackay, Caswell & Callahan in New York.  But some tax experts noted the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the 16th Amendment to give Congress broad latitude to tax as it sees fit. In a frequently cited 1934 decision, the Supreme Court called tax deductions a ‚Äúlegislative grace‚Äù rather than a vested right. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how they think they have a valid lawsuit here,‚Äù David Gamage, a professor of tax law at Indiana University‚Äôs Maurer School of Law, told Reuters last week, speaking generally about governors in blue states that could challenge the tax bill.  Cuomo also said on Thursday that New York is proposing a restructuring of its tax code. He provided no details.  A group of 13 law professors on Dec. 18 published a paper suggesting ways that high-tax states could minimize the effects of the SALT deduction cap.  Their suggestions included shifting more of the tax burden onto businesses in the form of higher employer-side payroll taxes, since the federal tax bill‚Äôs cap on SALT deductions only applies to individuals and not businesses. States also could raise taxes on pass-through entities, which the federal tax bill specifically benefits with a lower rate on a portion of their income. On Friday, Cuomo said he would allow state residents to make a partial or full pre-payment on their property tax bill before Jan. 1, allowing taxpapyers to deduct such payments for 2017 before the cap kicks in, prompting a wave of residents to pay early.  However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday advised homeowners that the pre-payment of 2018 property taxes may not be deductible. ",REAL

By Bernie Woodall (Reuters) - A man claiming to be the person who delivered a gift-wrapped package of horse manure at the Los Angeles home of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he did it to protest the federal tax overhaul signed into law last week by President Donald Trump. Robert Strong, 45, a psychologist for the Los Angeles County Mental Health Department, said by telephone he left the poop-filled parcel addressed to Mnuchin and Trump in the driveway outside Mnuchin‚Äôs home in the posh Bel Air community.  KNBC-TV, an NBC television affiliate in Los Angeles, reported Mnuchin was not home at the time. The package was found by Mnuchin‚Äôs neighbor.    ‚ÄúProtest really should be funny,‚Äù Strong told Reuters. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs eyes glaze over when they just see angry people in the streets.‚Äù He believes the new tax law will hurt poor people. Neither the U.S. Secret Service nor the Los Angeles Police Department, both of which investigated the incident, would confirm Strong was responsible. The Secret Service interviewed an individual who admitted delivering the package, but no charges had been filed against him as of Monday afternoon. LAPD Lieutenant Rob Weise said it was possible whoever left the package did not break any criminal laws. While he is not assigned to investigate the incident, Weise said if the box did not present any danger, it would not be illegal. The LAPD bomb squad X-rayed the box before opening it on Saturday. In a photo of the card Strong posted on Twitter, he wrote ‚ÄúMisters Mnuchin & Trump, We‚Äôre returning the ‚Äògift‚Äô of the Christmas tax bill‚Äù and signed it ‚ÄúWarmest wishes, The American people.‚Äù      Strong said a Secret Service agent, accompanied by six police officers, showed up at his house to question him on Sunday night, and the agent chided him, asking, ‚Äú‚ÄòAre you ashamed of your behavior?‚Äô‚Äù     The White House declined to comment on Monday and officials with the Treasury Department could not be reached.

Tiada Kejadian Letupan Atau Kebakaran  Melibatkan Sebuah Tren MRT Laluan Kajang ,"(Reuters) - A lottery drawing to settle a tied Virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed, state election officials said on Tuesday, after the Democratic candidate mounted a legal fight. The decision to put off the high-stakes lotto, originally scheduled for Wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by a single vote.  A victory by Simonds would shift Republicans‚Äô slim control of the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split with the Democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power-sharing arrangement. A day after Simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. That decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of Newport News in southeastern Virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. Simonds asked a state court to reconsider on Tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. An image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by Simonds‚Äô name. The voter selected Republicans for other offices. Simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, ‚Äúrecounts would become a never-ending spiral of courtroom challenges.‚Äù The chairman of the Virginia Board of Elections, James Alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered ‚Äúan action of last resort.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúAny substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.‚Äù    Yancey‚Äôs campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Virginia House Republican Caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. ‚ÄúWe believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,‚Äù spokesman Parker Slaybaugh said. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Andrea Gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. Democrats notched historic gains in Virginia‚Äôs statehouse elections last month, part of the party‚Äôs first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House last year. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Virginia Republicans held 66 seats to the Democrats‚Äô 34 in the House of Delegates, along with a majority in the state Senate. ",REAL
Tiada Kejadian Tanah Runtuh Di Pintu Masuk Terowong Genting Sempah ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Georgian-American businessman who met then-Miss Universe pageant owner Donald Trump in 2013, has been questioned by congressional investigators about whether he helped organize a meeting between Russians and Trump‚Äôs eldest son during the 2016 election campaign, four sources familiar with the matter said. The meeting at Trump Tower in New York involving Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign advisers is a focus of probes by Congress and Special Counsel Robert Mueller on whether campaign officials colluded with Russia when it sought to interfere in the U.S. election, the sources said. Russia denies allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election and President Donald Trump denies any collusion. The Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees recently questioned behind closed doors Irakly Kaveladze, a U.S. citizen born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the sources said. He is a U.S.-based representative of Azerbaijani oligarch Aras Agalarov‚Äôs real estate firm, the Crocus Group. The panels knew Kaveladze was at the June 9, 2016 meeting but became more interested in him after learning he also attended a private dinner in Las Vegas in 2013 with Trump and Agalarov as they celebrated an agreement to hold that year‚Äôs Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, the sources said.  Committee members now want to know more about the extent of Kaveladze‚Äôs contacts with the Trump family and whether he had a bigger role than previously believed in setting up the Trump Tower meeting when Trump was a Republican candidate for president. The White House declined to comment. Mueller‚Äôs office also declined to comment. Scott Balber, a New York lawyer who represents Kaveladze, confirmed that his client attended both the dinner in Las Vegas and the Trump Tower meeting but said he did not set up the second meeting. Trump‚Äôs son-in-law Jared Kushner, other Trump campaign aides, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya were also at that meeting. Lawyer Balber also said the committees were only seeking Kaveladze‚Äôs input as a witness and were not targeting him for investigation. ‚ÄúNo-one has ever told me that they have any interest in him other than as a witness,‚Äù Balber said. Lawyers for Trump Jr. and Kushner did not respond to requests for comment about their contacts with Kaveladze.¬†A lawyer for President Trump declined to comment. One photograph from the 2013 dinner, when Trump still owned the Miss Universe pageant, shows Agalarov and his pop singer son Emin along with Trump, two Trump aides and several other people at the dining table. Another shows Kaveladze standing behind Trump and Emin Agalarov as they speak. The pictures were found by a University of California at Irvine student and blogger Scott Stedman, who posted them on Nov. 22. Aras Agalarov is a billionaire property developer in Russia who was awarded the Order of Honor by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mueller‚Äôs team and the committees are looking for any evidence of a link between the Trump Tower meeting and the release six weeks later of emails stolen from Democratic Party organizations. They are also trying to determine whether there was any discussion at the New York meeting of lifting U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, a top priority for Putin, the officials said. Rob Goldstone, a British publicist, told Trump Jr. ahead of the New York meeting that Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya would be bringing damaging information about donations to a charity linked to Trump‚Äôs Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to emails later released by Trump Jr. Trump Jr. initially said the meeting was about Russian adoptions but later said it also included Veselnitskaya‚Äôs promises of information on the donations to the Clinton charity. He said he ultimately never received the information, although it was later posted on the Internet. In a statement issued after meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 7, Trump, Jr. said Goldstone and Veselnitskaya were in a conference room with him as well as Kaveladze and a translator. Balber said Kaveladze attended expecting to serve as a translator, although he did not do so in the end because Veselnitskaya brought her own. ",REAL

Dakwaan Kejadian Jambatan Runtuh Dan Dihanyutkan Di Johor Adalah Tidak Benar ,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court in Washington on Tuesday upheld a lower court‚Äôs decision to allow President Donald Trump‚Äôs commission investigating voter fraud to request data on voter rolls from U.S. states. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) watchdog group, which filed the lawsuit, did not have legal standing to seek to force the presidential commission to review privacy concerns before collecting individuals‚Äô voter data. EPIC had argued that under federal law, the commission was required to conduct a privacy-impact assessment before gathering personal data. But the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously that the privacy law at issue was intended to protect individuals, not groups like EPIC. ‚ÄúEPIC is not a voter,‚Äù Judge Karen Henderson wrote in the ruling.  Washington-based U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly first denied EPIC‚Äôs injunction request in July, in part because the collection of data by the commission was not technically an action by a government agency so was not bound by laws that govern what such entities can do.  Kollar-Kotelly noted that the commission, headed by Vice President Mike Pence, was an advisory body that lacks legal authority to compel states to hand over the data. Most state officials who oversee elections and election law experts say that voter fraud is rare in the United States. Trump, a Republican, set up the commission in May after charging, without evidence, that millions of people voted unlawfully in the 2016 presidential election in which he defeated Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton despite losing the popular vote.  The commission‚Äôs vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states in June to turn over voter information. The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories.  More than 20 states refused outright and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commission‚Äôs eventual findings could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder for groups that tend to favor Democratic candidates to cast ballots. EPIC executive director Marc Rotenberg could not immediately be reached for comment. ",REAL

Dakwaan JPAM Mengeluarkan Kenyataan Berkenaan Empangan Sembrong Adalah Tidak Benar ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Seattle partially blocked U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs newest restrictions on refugee admissions on Saturday, the latest legal defeat for his efforts to curtail immigration and travel to the United States. The decision by U.S. District Judge James Robart is the first judicial curb on rules the Trump administration put into place in late October that have contributed significantly to a precipitous drop in the number of refugees being admitted into the country. Refugees and groups that assist them argued in court that the administration‚Äôs policies violated the Constitution and federal rulemaking procedures, among other claims. Department of Justice attorneys argued in part that U.S. law grants the executive branch the authority to limit refugee admissions in the way that it had done so. On Oct. 24, the Trump administration effectively paused refugee admissions from 11 countries mostly in the Middle East and Africa, pending a 90-day security review, which was set to expire in late January. The countries subject to the review are Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. For each of the last three years, refugees from the 11 countries made up more than 40 percent of U.S. admissions. A Reuters review of State Department data showed that as the review went into effect, refugee admissions from the 11 countries plummeted. Robart ruled that the administration could carry out the security review, but that it could not stop processing or admitting refugees from the 11 countries in the meantime, as long as those refugees have a ‚Äúbona fide‚Äù connection to the United States. As part of its new restrictions, the Trump administration had also paused a program that allowed for family reunification for refugees, pending further security screening procedures being put into place. Robart ordered the government to re-start the program, known as ‚Äúfollow-to-join‚Äù. Approximately 2,000 refugees were admitted into the United States in fiscal year 2015 under the program, according to Department of Homeland Security data. Refugee advocacy groups praised Robart‚Äôs decision.  ‚ÄúThis ruling brings relief to thousands of refugees in precarious situations in the Middle East and East Africa, as well as to refugees already in the U.S. who are trying to reunite with their spouses and children,‚Äù said Mariko Hirose, litigation director for the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the case. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Lauren Ehrsam, said the department disagrees with Robart‚Äôs ruling and is ‚Äúcurrently evaluating the next steps‚Äù. Robart, who was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush, emerged from relative obscurity in February, when he issued a temporary order to lift the first version of Trump‚Äôs travel ban. On Twitter, Trump called him a ‚Äúso-called judge‚Äù whose ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù opinion ‚Äúessentially takes law-enforcement away from our country‚Äù. Robart‚Äôs ruling represented the second legal defeat in two days for the Trump administration. On Friday, a U.S. appeals court said Trump‚Äôs travel ban targeting six Muslim-majority countries should not be applied to people with strong U.S. ties, but said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Kenyataan Bahawa Dua Ribut Akan Bertembung Di Tengah Adalah Tidak Benar ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has issued new guidelines for immigration judges that remove some instructions for how to protect unaccompanied juveniles appearing in their courtrooms. A Dec. 20 memo, issued by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) replaces 2007 guidelines, spelling out policies and procedures judges should follow in dealing with children who crossed the border illegally alone and face possible deportation.  The new memo removes suggestions contained in the 2007 memo for how to conduct ‚Äúchild-sensitive questioning‚Äù and adds reminders to judges to maintain ‚Äúimpartiality‚Äù even though ‚Äújuvenile cases may present sympathetic allegations.‚Äù The new document also changes the word ‚Äúchild‚Äù to ‚Äúunmarried individual under the age of 18‚Äù in many instances. (Link to comparison: tmsnrt.rs/2BlT0VK May 2007 document: tmsnrt.rs/2BBR8wj December 2017 document: tmsnrt.rs/2C2sWCs)  An EOIR official said the new memo contained ‚Äúclarifications and updates‚Äù to 10-year-old guidance ‚Äúin order to be consistent with the laws as they‚Äôve been passed by Congress.‚Äù The new memo was posted on the Justice Department website but has not been previously reported.  Immigration advocates said they worry the new guidelines could make court appearances for children more difficult, and a spokeswoman for the union representing immigration judges said judges are concerned about the tone of the memo. President Donald Trump has made tougher immigration enforcement a key policy goal of his administration, and has focused particularly on trying to curb the illegal entry of children. The administration says it wants to prevent vulnerable juveniles from making perilous journeys to the United States and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants.  One changed section of the memo focuses on how to make children comfortable in the court in advance of hearings. The old guidance says they ‚Äúshould be permitted to explore‚Äù courtrooms and allowed to ‚Äúsit in all locations, (including, especially, the judge‚Äôs bench and the witness stand).‚Äù  The new guidance says such explorations should take place only ‚Äúto the extent that resources and time permit‚Äù and specifically puts the judge‚Äôs bench off limits. The new memo also warns judges to be skeptical, since an unaccompanied minor ‚Äúgenerally receives more favorable treatment under the law than other categories of illegal aliens,‚Äù which creates ‚Äúan incentive to misrepresent accompaniment status or age in order to attempt to qualify for the benefits.‚Äù It also says to be on the lookout for ‚Äúfraud and abuse,‚Äù language that was not in the previous memo. Immigration judges are appointed by the U.S. Attorney General and courts are part of the Department of Justice, not an independent branch. The only sitting immigration judges routinely allowed to speak to the media are representatives of their union, the National Association of Immigration Judges.  Dana Marks, a sitting judge and spokeswoman for the union, said the ‚Äúoverall tone‚Äù of the memo ‚Äúis very distressing and concerning to immigration judges.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThere is a feeling that the immigration courts are just being demoted into immigration enforcement offices, rather than neutral arbiters,‚Äù Marks said. ‚ÄúThere has been a relentless beating of the drum toward enforcement rather than due process.‚Äù   Former immigration judge Andrew Arthur, who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies, which promotes lower levels of immigration overall, said the new guidelines were needed.  In their previous form, he said, ‚Äúso much emphasis was placed on the potential inability of the alien to understand the proceedings ... that it almost put the judge into the position of being an advocate.‚Äù¬†  The courts have had to handle a surge in cases for unaccompanied minors, mostly from Central America, after their numbers sky-rocketed in 2014 as violence in the region caused residents to flee north.  While illegal crossings initially fell after Trump took office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that since May, each month has seen an increase in children being apprehended either alone or with family members.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a speech in Boston in September that the special accommodations for unaccompanied minors had been exploited by ‚Äúgang members who come to this country as wolves in sheep clothing.‚Äù Echoing some of these concerns, the new memo notes in a preamble that not all child cases involve innocents, and that the courts might see ‚Äúan adolescent gang member‚Äù or ‚Äúa teenager convicted as an adult for serious criminal activity.‚Äù  Jennifer Podkul, policy director of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND) said Congress included special procedural protections for immigrant children in a 2008 anti-trafficking bill to ‚Äúmake sure that a kid gets a fair shot in the courtroom.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese kids are by themselves telling a very complicated and oftentimes very traumatic story,‚Äù said Podkul. ‚ÄúThe approach of this memo, which is much more suspicious, is not going to help get to the truth of a child‚Äôs story.‚Äù  In cases where children are called to testify, the old guidance instructed judges to ‚Äúseek to limit the amount of time the child is on the stand.‚Äù The new guidance says that judges should ‚Äúconsider‚Äù limiting the child‚Äôs time on the stand ‚Äúwithout compromising due process for the opposing party,‚Äù which is generally a government prosecutor. The memo leaves in a range of special accommodations made for children, including allowing them to bring a pillow or booster seat or a ‚Äútoy, book, or other personal item.‚Äù It also maintains that cases involving unaccompanied minors should be heard on a separate docket when possible and that children should not be detained or transported with adults.

Dakwaan Bahawa Kawasan KL Sentral Banjir Adalah Tidak Benar ,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday said President Donald Trump‚Äôs hotly contested travel ban targeting people from six Muslim-majority countries should not be applied to people with strong U.S. ties. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers several West Coast states, also said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision on the latest version of the travel ban from the Trump administration by the U.S. Supreme Court. Since taking office in January, Trump has been struggling to enact a ban that passes court muster. A three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit narrowed a previous injunction from a lower federal court to those people ‚Äúwith a credible bona fide relationship with the United States.‚Äù It also said that while the U.S. president has broad powers to regulate the entry of immigrants into the United States, those powers are not without limits. ‚ÄúWe conclude that the President‚Äôs issuance of the Proclamation once again exceeds the scope of his delegated authority,‚Äù the panel said. The ban targets people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. Trump, a Republican, has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. The state of Hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a Honolulu federal judge said it exceeded Trump‚Äôs powers under immigration law. Trump‚Äôs ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. The same three-judge 9th Circuit panel, which limited a previous version of Trump‚Äôs ban, heard arguments earlier this month. Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests. He issued a revised one in March after the first was blocked by federal courts. That expired in September after a court fight and was replaced with the current version. The ban has some exceptions. Certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and applicants can ask for an individual waiver. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that the Supreme Court has already allowed the government to implement the proclamation and keep all Americans safe while this matter is litigated. We continue to believe that the order should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,‚Äù U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said in a statement. ",REAL
Kejadian Air Deras Berlaku Di Sungai Telemong Bukan Di Tasik Kenyir ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in Washington on Friday rejected a bid by President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration to prevent the U.S. military from accepting transgender recruits starting Jan. 1, the second court to issue such a ruling this week. Four federal judges around the country have issued injunctions blocking Trump‚Äôs ban on transgender people from the military, including one that was also handed down on Friday. The administration has appealed the previous three rulings. In a six-page order, the three-judge-panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the administration had ‚Äúnot shown a strong likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their challenge‚Äù to a district court‚Äôs order blocking the ban. On Thursday the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was denying the administration‚Äôs request while the appeal proceeds. The two courts‚Äô actions could prompt the administration to ask the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. Also on Friday, a federal trial court in Riverside, California, blocked the ban while the case proceeds, making it the fourth to do so, after similar rulings in Baltimore, Seattle and Washington, D.C. U.S. District Judge Jesus Bernal said without the injunction the plaintiffs, including current and aspiring service members, would suffer irreparable harm. ‚ÄúThere is nothing any court can do to remedy a government-sent message that some citizens are not worthy of the military uniform simply because of their gender,‚Äù he added. The administration had argued that the Jan. 1 deadline for accepting transgender recruits was problematic because tens of thousands of personnel would have to be trained on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants, and the military was not ready for that. The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits, but Trump‚Äôs defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1. In an August memorandum, Trump gave the military until March 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender individuals from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. The memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty personnel. ",REAL
Dakwaan Penutupan Laluan Gerik – Jeli Akibat Banjir Adalah Tidak Benar ,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru‚Äôs President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski could end up the surprise winner of an attempt to oust him from power this week, after some opposition lawmakers broke ranks with party leaders to support him, opening a divide that might strengthen his hand. Despite having a Congressional majority, the rightwing opposition party Popular Force was unable to push through a motion to remove Kuczynski from office on Thursday, after 10 of its own lawmakers broke ranks to save the president. The vote cemented a growing divide in the opposition and looked to threaten its control over Congress, potentially aiding Kuczynski as he tries to restore political stability and revive investments in one of Latin America‚Äôs most robust economies. The surprise defection was the result of a deal struck between Kuczynski and Popular Force rebel lawmaker Kenji Fujimori to get his father and ex-president Alberto Fujimori out of prison, alleged Popular Force secretary general, Jose Chlimper. Over the past year, Kenji has courted Kuczynski‚Äôs center-right government while challenging his sister Keiko‚Äôs leadership of the rightwing populist movement that their father formed in the 1990s. In defiance of his sister, Kenji threw his support behind Kuczynski ahead of the vote on whether to remove him from office over unproven graft allegations. Nine other Popular Force lawmakers followed his lead. ‚ÄúThis is the birth of a serious and formal split (in the Fujimori movement),‚Äù said Guillermo Loli, the head of political research for pollster Ipsos Peru. ‚ÄúEverything points to a pardon,‚Äù he added.     Kuczynski‚Äôs government denied that a pardon for Fujimori was part of its political negotiations. In an address to the nation late on Friday, Kuczynski said he would spend the coming days reflecting on his year and a half in office. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be announcing to you changes to make sure 2018 is not just a year of greater growth, but politically different,‚Äù Kuczynski said. Efforts to reach the Popular Force lawmakers who defected were not successful. One, Clayton Galvan, said on local TV channel Canal N that Alberto Fujimori called them from prison to ask them to help Kuczynski stay in power.     Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes, is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990-2000 term. Freeing him would likely anger the well-organized foes of the Fujimori clan - a mix of technocrats, leftists, human rights activists and academics. ‚ÄúThe day (Kuczynski) signs a pardon, he loses all of those guys. Permanently,‚Äù said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky. Support from the anti-Fujimori crowd was key to Kuczynski‚Äôs razor-thin victory over Keiko in last year‚Äôs presidential election, and to keeping the motion to oust him from succeeding. ‚ÄúKuczynski was saved by two diametrically opposed political groups: Kenji‚Äôs group and the left, which opposes a pardon. He can‚Äôt please both of them,‚Äù said Levitsky. Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former investment banker, took office amid hopes he would usher in cleaner government and faster economic growth. Instead, a graft scandal roiling Latin America has stalled investments and ensnared him in allegations of wrongdoing. Before the vote on Thursday, Kuczynski fanned fears of a return to Peru‚Äôs authoritarian past and described the motion as part of a legislative ‚Äúcoup‚Äù attempt by Keiko‚Äôs supporters. Popular Force denies the charge and says the bid to remove him was part of its fight against corruption and within the bounds of the constitution. A hardline Popular Force lawmaker loyal to Keiko, Hector Becerril, said the Kenji faction represented ‚Äútraitors.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf they have any sense of decency after this vote, the least they could do is present their resignations,‚Äù Becerril told journalists on Friday. ‚ÄúHopefully today.‚Äù With 10 votes fewer, Popular Force would command 61 seats in the 130-member, single-chamber Congress, less than an absolute majority, though it would still be the biggest voting bloc. The political crisis has cost Kuczynski his interior minister, Carlos Basombrio, who announced his resignation on Friday.

Trump said he wanted to sign the tax bill before leaving Washington on Friday for his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rather than stage a more formal ceremony in January, so he could keep his promise to finish work before Christmas. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want you folks to say I wasn‚Äôt keeping my promise. I‚Äôm keeping my promise,‚Äù he told reporters in the White House. The two pieces of legislation represent Trump‚Äôs most significant accomplishment with Congress since taking office in January, as well as a sign of what awaits when he returns from Florida after the Christmas holiday. The tax package, the largest such overhaul since the 1980s, slashes the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. Trump praised several companies that have announced employee bonuses in the wake of the bill‚Äôs passage, naming AT&T, Boeing, Wells Fargo, Comcast  and Sinclair Broadcast Group. ‚ÄúCorporations are literally going wild over this,‚Äù he said.      Democrats had opposed the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt during the next decade. The spending bill extends federal funding through Jan. 19, largely at current levels. It does nothing to resolve broader disputes over immigration, healthcare and military spending. Republicans also are divided over whether to follow up their sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code with a dramatic restructuring of federal benefit programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he would like to revamp welfare and health programs but Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told National Public Radio on Monday that he was not interested in cutting those programs without Democratic support. Trump‚Äôs year also closes with significant turnover of many top staffers who had been in the White House since early in his term. On Friday, the White House confirmed Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn and Jeremy Katz, who worked under White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, were leaving. ",REAL
Amaran Taufan Dan Tsunami Berkelajuan 150-200 KM/J Bakal Menuju Ke Borneo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators said on Friday that because the new tax bill could make timely financial reporting difficult, public companies can make reasonable estimates when uncertain of the impact of the new tax law in financial reports, and will have up to a year to report final numbers.               The Securities and Exchange Commission bulletin comes after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned on Thursday that some U.S. listed companies may struggle to file their annual financial reports on time because the Republican-led overhaul of the country‚Äôs tax system may prompt a raft of additional disclosures. In a statement on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA) issued on Friday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and Commissioners Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar said guidance was similar to that given in the past when tax law changes affected financial reporting. The $1.5 trillion tax bill, signed into law on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump, will significantly affect many companies‚Äô year-end financial statements because listing rules oblige them to flag any potential material risks or changes to their operations and financial outlook to shareholders. The bill significantly lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies - to 21 percent from 35 percent - allows them to repatriate cash from overseas, and modifies numerous deductions, among other changes.  Public companies have been given a ‚Äúmeasurement period‚Äù to study the changes created by a new law. During the measurement period, the SEC expects companies to complete their accounting and that ‚Äúin no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date,‚Äù of the TJCA. Companies will also need to make disclosures during the measurement period, including any updates to provisional amounts given earlier, or newly discovered reporting implications from tax bill. For companies with fiscal years ending Dec. 31, getting the necessary analysis done in time could be tough, the Chamber said. The tax bill It is the largest such overhaul since the 1980. In addition to slashing the corporate rate, it temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals.     ",REAL

In an end-of-year news conference, McConnell touted a list of Republican accomplishments since President Donald Trump took office in January. It started with the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and ended with an overhaul of the  U.S. tax code. But in January, McConnell‚Äôs already razor-thin 52-48 Republican majority will shrink to 51-49 with the swearing in of Senator-elect Doug Jones, the Democrat who surprised the political world with a win in a special election in the deeply Republican state of Alabama. Adding to McConnell‚Äôs difficulties, special Senate procedures are fading that allowed him to pass a tax bill and try to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year without any Democratic support. That means that McConnell‚Äôs victories - if he has them - will require more collaboration and less confrontation. The pivot was the centerpiece of his news conference remarks.  ‚ÄúThere are areas where I think we can get bipartisan agreement,‚Äù McConnell said. First on his list was legislation to change Dodd-Frank banking regulations that he said would help smaller financial institutions. The Kentucky senator noted that Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo has advanced legislation that is co-sponsored by several Democrats. McConnell also pointed to bipartisan efforts to help undocumented immigrants, known as ‚ÄúDreamers,‚Äù who were brought into the United States when they were children. If negotiators from both parties can come to a deal for the Dreamers that Trump‚Äôs administration can support, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll spend floor time on that in January,‚Äù McConnell said. On Thursday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer complained that throughout 2017 Republicans ‚Äúhave been hell-bent on pursuing a partisan agenda.‚Äù When asked by a reporter of possible bipartisan successes in 2018, Schumer pointed to the need for infrastructure improvements but said that Trump has been ‚Äúall over the lot‚Äù on how to accomplish road, airport and other construction projects. With the November 2018 congressional elections approaching, Democrats might have less incentive to cooperate with Republicans, especially after Schumer‚Äôs party won decisive victories in special elections this month and last in Alabama and Virginia. McConnell hinted it would be tougher to find agreement with Democrats on some other legislative issues, including welfare reform, which Trump says he wants to push ahead with in 2018. McConnell said he would consult with Trump and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan in January over prospects for welfare reform.  ",REAL

Callista Gingrich, 51, an author, documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, presented her credentials to Pope Francis at the Vatican to officially assume her role. Her husband Newt Gingrich was an early supporter and vocal ally of U.S. President Donald Trump. Newt Gingrich is expected to continue his role as a political contributor to Fox News from his new base in Rome. Trump‚Äôs nomination of Callista Gingrich to the post at the Holy See in May caused some controversy because of her marriage to Gingrich, with whom she became involved when he was still married to his second wife. Both are Roman Catholic. On Thursday they attended the funeral at the Vatican of Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned as Archbishop of Boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests.  The pope has implicitly criticized Trump‚Äôs decision to pull out of the Paris accord on climate change.

PETRONAS Tidak Menutup Operasi Pelantar Di Malaysia ," KING OF PRUSSIA, Pennsylvania/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the Fox & Hound sports bar, next to a shopping mall in suburban Philadelphia, four Democrats are giving speeches to potential voters as they begin their journey to try to unseat Republican congressman Pat Meehan in next year‚Äôs elections. Winning this congressional district - Pennsylvania‚Äôs 7th - is key to Democrats‚Äô hopes of gaining the 24 seats they need to retake the U.S. House of Representatives next November. The stakes are high - control of the House would allow them to block President Donald Trump‚Äôs legislative agenda. On the surface, Democrats face a significant hurdle. In nearly two-thirds of 34 Republican-held districts that are top of the party‚Äôs target list, household income or job growth, and often both, have risen faster than state and national averages over the past two years, according to a Reuters analysis of census data.¬†(Graphic:¬†tmsnrt.rs/2Bgq29K) That is potentially vote-winning news for Republican incumbents, who in speeches and television ads can trumpet a strengthening economy as a product of Republican control of Washington, even though incomes and job growth began improving under former Democratic President Barack Obama. ‚ÄúThe good economy is really the only positive keeping Republicans afloat,‚Äù said David Wasserman, a congressional analyst with the non-partisan Cook Political Report. Still, trumpeting the good economy may have limited impact among voters in competitive districts like this mostly white southeast region of Pennsylvania bordering Delaware and New Jersey, which has switched between both parties twice in the past 15 years. Many of the two dozen voters that Reuters interviewed in the 6th and 7th districts agreed the economy was strong, that jobs were returning and wages were growing. A handful were committed Republicans and Democrats who always vote the party line. About half voted for Meehan last year, but most of those said they were unsure whether they would vote for him again in 2018. Some said they were disappointed with the Republican Party‚Äôs handling of healthcare and tax reform as well as Trump‚Äôs erratic performance. About half also felt that despite an improving economy, living costs are squeezing the middle class. Drew McGinty, one of the Democratic hopefuls at the Fox & Hound bar hoping to unseat Meehan, said the good economic numbers were misleading. ‚ÄúWhen I talk to people across the district, I hear about stagnant wages. I hear about massive debt young people are getting when they finish college. There‚Äôs a lot out there not being told by the numbers,‚Äù he said. Still, Meehan, who won by 19 points in last November‚Äôs general election, is confident the strong economy will help him next year. He plans to run as a job creator and a champion of the middle class. ‚ÄúThe first thing people look at is whether they have got a job and income,‚Äù Meehan said in a telephone interview. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton carried the district by more than two points in the White House race, giving Democrats some hope that they can peel it away from Republicans next November. Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said the election will essentially be a referendum on Trump. The economy might help Republicans, he said, but other issues will likely be uppermost in voters‚Äô minds, like the Republican tax overhaul - which is seen by some as favoring the rich over the middle class - and Trump‚Äôs dismantling of President Barack Obama‚Äôs initiative to expand healthcare to millions of Americans, popularly known as Obamacare. Indeed, healthcare is Americans‚Äô top concern, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted earlier this month. Next is terrorism and then the economy. ‚ÄúHealthcare will be the No. 1 issue,‚Äù in the election, predicted Molly Sheehan, another Democrat running to unseat Meehan. Democrats have warned that dismantling Obamacare will leave millions of Americans without health coverage, and political analysts say Republicans in vulnerable districts could be punished by angry voters. Republicans argue that Obamacare drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. In Broomall, a hamlet in the 7th District, local builder Greg Dulgerian, 55, said he voted for Trump and Meehan. He still likes Trump because of his image as a political outsider, but he is less certain about Meehan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy, which is good,‚Äù Dulgerian said. ‚ÄúBut I actually make less than I did 10 years ago, because my living costs and costs of materials have gone up.‚Äù Dulgerian said he was not sure what Meehan was doing to address this, and he was open to a Democratic candidate with a plan to help the middle class. Ida McCausland, 65, is a registered Republican but said she is disappointed with the party. She views the overhaul of the tax system as a giveaway to the rich that will hit the middle class. ‚ÄúI will probably just go Democrat,‚Äù she said. Still, others interviewed said the good economy was the most important issue for them and would vote for Meehan. ¬†¬†¬† Mike Allard, 35, a stocks day trader, voted for Clinton last year but did not cast a ballot in the congressional vote. He thinks the economy will help Meehan next year and is leaning toward voting for him. ‚ÄúLocal businesses like the way the economy is going right now,‚Äù he said. In the 7th district median household income jumped more than 10 percent from 2014 to 2016, from $78,000 to around $86,000, above the national average increase of 7.3 percent, while job growth held steady, the analysis of the census data shows. Overall, the U.S. economy has grown 3 percent in recent quarters, and some forecasters now think the¬†stimulus from the Republican tax cuts will sustain that rate of growth through next year. Unemployment has dropped to 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. In midterm congressional elections, history shows that voters often focus on issues other than the economy. In 1966 the economy was thriving, but President Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs Democrats suffered a net loss of 47 seats, partly because of growing unhappiness with the Vietnam War. In 2006, again the economy was humming, but Republicans lost a net 31 seats in the House, as voters focused on the Iraq war and the unpopularity of Republican President George W. Bush. In 2010, despite pulling the economy out of a major recession, Democrats lost control of the House to Republicans, mainly because of the passage of Obamacare, which at the time was highly unpopular with many voters. ‚ÄúWhen times are bad, the election is almost always about the economy. When the economy is good, people have the freedom and the ability to worry about other issues,‚Äù said Stu Rothenberg, a veteran political analyst. ",REAL
Kerajaan Tidak Mampu Untuk Meningkatkan Gaji Minimum ? ,"(Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has told refugee agencies it will sharply pare back the number of offices across the country authorized to resettle people in 2018 as President Donald Trump cuts the number of refugees allowed into the United States. The announcement was made at a Dec. 1 meeting in Washington with State Department officials and representatives from nine major refugee agencies, several executives of the agencies said. Advocates said the decision is likely to lead to the closure of dozens of resettlement offices around the country, potentially leaving some refugees without access to services that help them integrate into American life. Several state refugee coordinators said they had also been made aware of the closures. ¬†¬†¬† Refugee resettlement in the United States is handled by nine non-profit agencies that receive funding from the federal government for some of their refugee work. They partner with, or oversee, hundreds of local offices in nearly every state that help new arrivals with basic tasks like enrolling children in school, arranging doctors‚Äô visits and applying for Social Security cards and other documents.  Though the agencies are independent, they must get government approval for where they will resettle new refugees.  Aid workers and state officials involved in refugee resettlement said the agencies were informed by the State Department in the Dec. 1 meeting that offices expected to handle fewer than 100 refugees in fiscal year 2018 will no longer be authorized to resettle new arrivals, which means many of them will have to close. There are about 300 resettlement offices spread across 49 states, and advocates estimate several dozen are at risk, though shuttering plans will not be finalized until next year. The Trump administration has said it wants refugees to assimilate quickly, both to promote national security and so that they can become self-sufficient. Refugee advocates say the closure of local offices will undermine that goal. They say the offices play a crucial role in helping newcomers traumatized from having fled conflict or persecution. Even if no new refugees are resettled by the offices they still have an obligation to help those already here, they say.  If refugees lose access to ‚Äúservices to help them navigate the processes of registering for school, and English classes and finding a job, that will mean that it will take longer for them to navigate life in the United States and contribute to our economy,‚Äù said Robert Carey, who directed the Office of Refugee Resettlement under former President Barack Obama.  A State Department official confirmed the Dec. 1 meeting and said the agency is looking to ‚Äúreduce costs and simplify management structures to help the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program run in a way that is fiscally responsible and sustainable.‚Äù  Some conservative groups that favor lower immigration said they would welcome curbs on the agencies‚Äô activities. ‚ÄúThese organizations have to adapt when their services are no longer needed as much,‚Äù said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies. ‚ÄúThere is no reason to keep funneling money to them.‚Äù Joshua Meservey, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation who formerly worked in refugee resettlement, said that costs need to be balanced against benefits. ‚ÄúIt is unclear to me if the assimilation gains are great enough to justify the extra expense‚Äù of funding the smaller agencies, he said. The nine agencies are now trying to coordinate closures so that they can maintain at least one resettlement agency in as many states as possible, several agency executives said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping that they (the State Department) only close sites where there is possible duplication,‚Äù said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, one of the nine agencies. ‚ÄúThis is going to have to be a negotiation and a process.‚Äù Since taking office in January, Trump has moved to sharply reduce refugee admissions to the United States, because of national security concerns and a belief that money could be better spent resettling people closer to their original homes. Soon after taking office, he slashed the 2017 U.S. refugee cap to 50,000 from the 110,000 ceiling set by Obama. In September, he announced a cap of 45,000 for 2018, the lowest number since the modern U.S. refugee program was established in 1980. The resettlement office in Chattanooga, Tennessee is at risk of shutting down, because it is only projected to receive about 85 refugees, said Holly Johnson, the state‚Äôs refugee coordinator. ‚ÄúSmall doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean weak or subpar,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúThey spend more time with folks, they have really well-established connections to the community, so people feel welcomed, which really helps.‚Äù Until this year, Idaho had four resettlement offices - three in Boise and one in Twin Falls, said Jan Reeves, director of the Idaho Office for Refugees, a non-profit which administers resettlement in the state. Earlier this year one of the sites in Boise shut down, he said. ‚ÄúIt was disruptive, and we‚Äôve lost a really valuable partner and we‚Äôve lost some capacity to do the job,‚Äù he said. ",REAL
"Projek Forest City Tidak Beri Sumbangan Kepada Johor, Dan Negara? ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire, sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating through Jan. 19. With lawmakers eager to begin a holiday recess until Jan. 3, the House of Representatives and Senate scurried to pass the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively. When Congress returns, lawmakers will immediately have to get back to work on appropriating more money for a fiscal year that already will be three months old. They will try to pass an ‚Äúomnibus‚Äù spending bill to fund the government from Jan. 19 through Sept. 30. Negotiators have been struggling for months over thorny issues such as the amount of defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment and ‚Äúanti-terrorism‚Äù activities. Fiscal hawks, meanwhile, are angry that Congress is again moving to bust through spending caps that had been designed to tamp down mounting federal debt. But some of those same lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion. With the clock ticking toward a deadline of midnight on Friday when government funding would run out, Democrats in the House and Senate made a strong pitch for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, popularly known as ‚ÄúDreamers.‚Äù In the end, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed. But nearly all of the House‚Äôs 193 Democrats and 29 of the Senate‚Äôs 46 Democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure. Shortly before the House and Senate votes, Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez told reporters, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really tired of tomorrow,‚Äù referring to years of failed attempts in Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation, allow them to legally work in the United States and get on a path to citizenship. They will resume their fight in January, aiming to win on the next spending bill or a separate measure. Trump has eliminated Obama-era temporary protections for Dreamers, but has asked Congress to come up with a permanent solution by March. In the meantime, about 122 Dreamers a day are becoming vulnerable to deportation while Congress bickers. Also on Thursday, the Senate put the brakes on another bill that passed the House, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states hit by this year‚Äôs hurricanes or wildfires. The temporary spending bill did, however, give Trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair. The bill includes $2.85 billion to fund the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program through March and funding for community health centers and the Indian Health Service. The plan also would extend the National Security Agency‚Äôs expiring internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, through Jan. 19. Other provisions address funding for veterans, the Coast Guard and flood insurance. Most government programs would be temporarily extended until Jan. 19 at fiscal 2017 levels. ",REAL

The following are the major items that were debated on the legislation that President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law: The Friday midnight deadline for action was the result of the Republican-controlled Congress failing to pass any of the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Instead, the government has been operating on a series of temporary measures. This newest stopgap bill continues funding for government operations through Jan. 19, giving lawmakers several weeks to work out a spending bill that would pay for agency activities through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.  House of Representatives conservatives failed in their bid to attach a major defense spending increase that would fund the Pentagon through September. Instead, Congress agreed to fund the military through Jan. 19, like most other programs. But in a move to attract support, a $4.7 billion increase was included to be used for missile defense and ship repair. Democrats and Republicans will continue negotiations on higher funding for both military and non-military programs. An $81 billion disaster aid bill was going to be attached to the government funding bill. Instead, the House approved it as a stand-alone bill, only to see the Senate put off action until at least next month. It would build on about $52 billion already provided to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states hit by severe hurricanes, wildfires or other natural disasters. Democrats want to do more for Puerto Rico and some Republicans worry about the mounting costs of disaster aid. The Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program, which helps provide medical care to nearly 9 million children in low-income families, will get $2.85 billion to cover expenses through March as lawmakers seek a more permanent solution. Senators put off until early next year their bid to maintain healthcare subsidies for low-income people participating in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Many House Republican lawmakers dislike the idea. The National Security Agency‚Äôs warrantless internet surveillance program under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will be extended through Jan. 19 as lawmakers try to reconcile competing versions of such legislation in the House and Senate.  Legislation to protect ‚ÄúDreamers‚Äù from deportation was not included, despite Democrats‚Äô push to resolve the issue by year‚Äôs end. It was a major disappointment for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups. But negotiators are still trying to reach a deal on helping immigrants, many from Mexico and Central America, brought to the United States illegally as children. The issue is expected to come back to life in early 2018.   ",REAL
Pelaburan LTAT Dalam AES Terancam Berikutan Pengambilalihan AES Oleh Kerajaan? ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York on Thursday threw out a lawsuit that had accused President Donald Trump of violating the U.S. Constitution by accepting foreign payments through his hotels and other businesses, handing him a major victory on an issue that has dogged him since even before he took office in January. Though other lawsuits remain pending that make similar claims, the ruling by U.S. District Judge George Daniels is the first to weigh the merits of the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs anti-corruption provisions as they apply to Trump, a wealthy businessman who as president regularly visits his own hotels, resorts and golf clubs. In a 29-page opinion granting the Trump administration‚Äôs request to toss the suit, Daniels said the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to bring the suit. The plaintiffs included the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a hotel owner, a hotel events booker and a restaurant trade group. The lawsuit, filed after the Republican president took office in January, accused Trump of running afoul of the Constitution‚Äôs ‚Äúemoluments‚Äù clause by maintaining ownership of his business empire while in office.  The emoluments clause, designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence, bars U.S. officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump has ceded day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons. Critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard. The plaintiffs said they are legally injured when foreign governments try to ‚Äúcurry favor‚Äù with Trump by paying to use his businesses, such as the Trump International Hotel in Washington or a high-end restaurant at a Trump hotel in New York City.

"Dakwaan Terdapat Bantuan Kewangan Sehingga RM2,000 Secara One-Off Untuk Pelajar IPT Adalah Tidak Benar ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The ethics probe into U.S. Representative Blake Farenthold, who is already under a cloud for alleged sexual misconduct, is being expanded to look into whether he mixed his political campaign with congressional work and lied to the House Ethics Committee, the panel said on Thursday. Last week, Farenthold said he would not seek re-election next year after accounts surfaced that he created a hostile work environment. The Texas Republican denied allegations of sexual harassment but admitted allowing an unprofessional culture in his Capitol Hill office. On Thursday the ethics committee voted unanimously to investigate whether Farenthold used his congressional staff and other resources of the House of Representatives to further his political campaign, and if he had made false statements or omissions to the committee. The panel was already looking into whether he committed sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation against a former staff member and if he made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff.  The committee said the announcement should not be read as an indication that it had found any rule violations. Farenthold‚Äôs office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Congress strictly divides lawmakers‚Äô work on Capitol Hill and their runs for re-election so that taxpayers do not end up subsidizing political campaigns. In August, the committee went so far as to warn Representatives, who face elections every two years, they should not even send texts or forward emails related to their campaigns while in House buildings. Congress is reviewing its workplace policies on sexual harassment after a number of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks amid a wave of such allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media. A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House said on Thursday intends to introduce legislation in January reforming a 20-year-old law that covers sexual harassment in Congress, which it hopes will pass soon after.

Dakwaan Lebih 200 Sekolah Agama Diarah Tutup Adalah Tidak Benar ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in Virginia on Thursday rejected a bid by President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration to prevent the U.S. military from accepting transgender recruits starting Jan. 1. The administration had urged the appeals court to suspend an order by a federal judge in Baltimore for the armed forces to begin accepting transgender recruits on that date. The administration has said the Jan. 1 start date was causing the armed forces to scramble to revise their policies at the risk of harming military readiness.  In a brief two-paragraph order, the three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was denying the administration‚Äôs request while the appeal proceeds. All three judges are Democratic appointees.  The court‚Äôs action could prompt the administration to ask the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. ‚ÄúWe disagree with the court‚Äôs ruling and are currently evaluating the next steps,‚Äù U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said in a statement. Several transgender service members, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed suit in Maryland after Trump said in July he would ban transgender people from the military, a move that would reverse a policy of the Republican president‚Äôs Democratic predecessor Barack Obama to accept them. Trump cited concern over military focus and medical costs. So far, three federal judges around the country have issued injunctions blocking Trump‚Äôs ban. His administration has appealed all three rulings.  Joshua Block, an ACLU attorney who represents the plaintiffs in the Maryland case, said he was happy the appeals court saw through the government‚Äôs ‚Äúsmokescreen‚Äù to further delay enlistment.  Thursday‚Äôs action was in response to the administration‚Äôs appeal of a Nov. 21 ruling by U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis, who said that the transgender prohibition likely violates the plaintiffs‚Äô constitutional right to equal protection under the law. The Garbis ruling followed a similar one on Oct. 30 by another federal judge in Washington, D.C. A third judge in Seattle also ruled against the administration on Dec. 11. In an August memorandum, Trump gave the military until March 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender people from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. The memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty military personnel. The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1 of this year to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump‚Äôs defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, which the president‚Äôs ban then put off indefinitely. The Trump administration said in legal papers that the armed forces are not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept ‚Äúsome individuals who are not medically fit for service.‚Äù The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants‚Äô sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The ban‚Äôs challengers said the memo contradicted the claim that the military was not ready.  The Justice Department disagreed, telling the court on Wednesday that ‚Äúall this memorandum shows is that the military is scrambling to comply with the injunction.‚Äù The lawsuit‚Äôs lead plaintiff Brock Stone, 34, has served in the U.S. Navy for 11 years, including a nine-month deployment to Afghanistan, and wants to remain for at least 20 years, according to court papers.

In a letter sent to Justice Department Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, 171 of the 193 Democrats in the House said they support Mueller‚Äôs probe, and urged Rosenstein to let it continue ‚Äúunfettered by political influence or threats to his authority.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe will not stand by and allow Fox News and right-wing Republicans to defy the rule of law and create their own rules to interfere with the legitimate investigation under the Constitution of the United States,‚Äù California Democrat Maxine Waters said during a press conference Thursday. ‚ÄúThere is an organized effort by Republicans ... to spin a false narrative and conjure up outrageous scenarios to accuse Special Counsel Mueller of being biased,‚Äù she added. Rosenstein appointed Mueller as Special Counsel in May, after President Donald Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey for what Trump later said was ‚Äúthis Russia thing.‚Äù Critics promptly accused the president of trying to obstruct the probe. Mueller is investigating whether Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election. Russia has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion.  Republican criticism of Mueller, himself a member of their party, has intensified in recent months since he charged four of Trump‚Äôs close associates, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Republicans and talk show hosts on Fox News have accused Mueller‚Äôs team and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of bias, citing issues including anti-Trump text messages exchanged between two FBI staffers who previously worked on Mueller‚Äôs team. House Republicans have launched their own investigation into the FBI‚Äôs handling of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, and questioned whether she received favorable treatment after no charges were brought. Recently, rumors have flown around Washington that Trump may be seeking to have Mueller fired. Trump‚Äôs lawyers have said that is not true. Rosenstein, also a Republican, oversees Mueller‚Äôs team. He can only fire Mueller for good cause, and he told Congress last week he sees no legitimate basis for doing so. ‚ÄúThis investigation must continue unimpeded,‚Äù House Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Jerrold Nadler said Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. in Oakland, California, said the federal government likely did not follow proper administrative procedures in promulgating the new rules, and put them on hold while a lawsuit challenging their legality proceeds. The decision followed a similar ruling from a federal judge in Philadelphia last Friday that blocked the administration from enforcing rules it announced in October allowing businesses or nonprofits to obtain exemptions on moral or religious grounds. Gilliam ruled on a lawsuit pursued by Democratic attorneys general in California, Delaware, Maryland, New York and Virginia. He said that a preliminary injunction was necessary given the ‚Äúdire public health and fiscal consequences‚Äù that could result as a result of the administration adopting the rules without the input of interested parties. ‚ÄúIf the Court ultimately finds in favor of Plaintiffs on the merits, any harm caused in the interim by rescinded contraceptive coverage would not be susceptible to remedy,‚Äù he wrote. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that, given last week‚Äôs decision in Pennsylvania, ‚Äútoday‚Äôs ruling amounts to a one-two punch against the Trump administration‚Äôs unlawful overreach.‚Äù The U.S. Justice Department defended the rules in court.  Lauren Ehrsam, a department spokeswoman, said the agency disagreed with the ruling and was evaluating its next steps. ‚ÄúThis administration is committed to defending the religious liberty of all Americans and we look forward to doing so in court,‚Äù Ehrsam said in a statement. The lawsuit is among several that Democratic state attorneys general filed after the Republican Trump administration revealed the new rules on Oct. 6, which targeted the contraceptive mandate implemented as part of 2010‚Äôs Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The rules will let businesses or nonprofits lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law‚Äôs mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage in health insurance with no co-payment.

Penjelasan ’Skala Gred SPM’ Yang Tular Di Media Sosial ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Thursday urged federal authorities to halt the planned expansion of a $1 billion airport facial scanning program, saying the technology used to identify travelers on some flights departing from nine U.S. airports for international destinations may not be not accurate enough and raises privacy concerns. Congress has approved the use of the program for non-U.S. citizens, but never expressly authorized its use for Americans. The Department of Homeland Security has said the system is needed to prevent travelers from leaving the country using someone else‚Äôs identity and to prevent visitors to the United States from overstaying their visas. Senators Mike Lee, a Republican, and Edward Markey, a Democrat, in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, raised concerns that too many travelers would be inconvenienced by faulty scan results and questioned why Americans are being subjected to the screens, known as biometric exit detection technology.  In the letter, they raised objections to expanding the program beyond the nine airports where it is already in use. ‚ÄúWe request that DHS stop the expansion of this program and provide Congress with its explicit statutory authority to use and expand a biometric exit program on U.S. citizens,‚Äù the senators wrote. ‚ÄúIf there is no specific authorization, then we request an explanation for why DHS believes it has the authority to proceed‚Äù They cited a report released Thursday by Georgetown University Law School‚Äôs Center on Privacy & Technology that found DHS is conducting the scans ‚Äúwithout basic legal and technical safeguards - or any meaningful justification of its billion-dollar cost.‚Äù Congress in 2016 authorized spending up to $1 billion over 10 years on the facial scans. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on its website, says the program collects ‚Äúfacial images from all travelers from the United States‚Äù on a flight and uses the images to verify identities. It says the images are stored for no more than two weeks and says that ‚ÄúCBP is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all travelers.‚Äù The government said Thursday that U.S. citizens may opt out of the facial screening and instead have a separate review of their ID documents. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman said the government is working to establish the biometric exit program ‚Äúin a way that‚Äôs most efficient and secure for the traveler and that is least disruptive for the travel industry.‚Äù Airports using the system include Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York‚Äôs John F. Kennedy, Washington Dulles, both Houston airports, Chicago O‚ÄôHare and Atlanta. The senators want DHS to provide data that the program will not unduly burden travelers. DHS said previously its goal is a 96 percent ‚Äútrue accept rate,‚Äù meaning the technology can positively identify 96 percent of the faces it scans. The senators, however, said this meant ‚Äúthere would still be a false denial for one in 25 travelers. Further there is evidence that certain face scans exhibit different error rate depending on the race or gender of the person being scanned.‚Äù DHS has said travelers who cannot be verified are escorted to another area where Customs and Border Patrol uses other methods to verify their identity. The Georgetown Law report also noted that DHS has not established any rules governing the program.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if DHS has hired a billion-dollar bouncer to check IDs but never checked how good he is at spotting a fake,‚Äù said Laura Moy, deputy director of the center and co-author of the report. ‚ÄúThey also don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs biased against certain groups of people.‚Äù The senators said DHS also needed safeguards to ensure facial data is not shared with other U.S. agencies.

Dakwaan Pihak KPM Menyediakan Kertas Soalan Setara Tahun 6 Yang Akan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday launched an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign supplies of critical minerals used in smartphones, computers and military equipment, which he said poses a national security and economic risk. Under a directive from President Donald Trump, Zinke will  work with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to publish in 60 days a list of non-fuel minerals that are vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and necessary for manufacturing and will develop a strategy to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign suppliers. The policy would aim to identify new domestic sources of critical minerals; increase domestic exploration, mining and  recycling; giving miners and producers electronic access to better mapping and geological data; and streamlining leasing and permitting for new mines. ‚ÄúThe United States must not remain reliant on foreign competitors like Russia and China for the critical minerals needed to keep our economy strong and our country safe,‚Äù Trump said. The order comes after the Interior Department and the U.S. Geological Survey published a report earlier this week that detailed U.S. dependence on foreign competitors for its supply of certain minerals. The report identified 23 out of 88 minerals that are priorities for U.S. national defense and the economy because they are components in products ranging from batteries to military equipment. The list included rare earths metals, lithium, graphite and other minerals.  That report did not offer policy recommendations, but Zinke said he would rely on the findings as he prioritizes research into certain mineral deposit areas on federal land and plans policies to promote mining. Twenty of the 23 critical minerals that the United States relies on are sourced from China. Much of the world‚Äôs lithium is produced in Australia and Chile, with the bulk of the world‚Äôs reserves straddling huge salt flats in the so-called lithium triangle of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina.  Lithium exports from Chile, for example, approached $600 million in 2016, or roughly 40 percent of the global market by volume, according to Chile development agency Corfo.

Pelajar Tingkatan 1 Hingga 4 Akan Kembali Ke Sekolah Pada 12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. intelligence community on Thursday pressed Congress to renew the National Security Agency‚Äôs expiring surveillance law, warning in a rare public statement that national security may be endangered if lawmakers let it lapse. The message from the intelligence chiefs sought to apply pressure on lawmakers who appeared to abandon an effort this week to pass legislation that would have reauthorized for several years the NSA‚Äôs warrantless internet spying program, which is due to expire on Dec. 31. That plan cratered late on Wednesday amid objections from a sizable coalition of Republicans and Democrats who want to have more privacy safeguards in the program, which chiefly targets foreigners but also collects communications from an unknown number of Americans. Instead, House Republicans unveiled a stopgap funding measure on Thursday that includes an extension of the surveillance law until Jan. 19. The law, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is considered by U.S. intelligence agencies to be vital to national security. ‚ÄúThere is no substitute for Section 702,‚Äù Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the directors the NSA, FBI and CIA wrote in the joint statement, adding that failure to renew the authority would make it easier for foreign adversaries to ‚Äúplan attacks against our citizens and allies without detection.‚Äù Section 702 allows the NSA to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States. But the program incidentally gathers communications of Americans for a variety of technical reasons, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas. Those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Some lawmakers in both parties want to eliminate or partially restrict the U.S. government‚Äôs ability to review data of Americans collected under Section 702 without first obtaining a warrant. The intelligence chiefs also criticized the current plan to temporarily extend the program, saying short-term extensions ‚Äúfail to provide certainty and will create needless and wasteful operational complications.‚Äù U.S. officials recently acknowledged the end-year deadline may not matter much because of a belief the program can lawfully continue through April due to the way it is annually certified.

Dakwaan Bahawa KPM Ada Menyatakan Pembukaan Semula Sekolah Adalah Tidak Benar ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval on Wednesday to the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, sending a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax bill to President Donald Trump for his signature. In sealing Trump‚Äôs first major legislative victory since he took office in January, Republicans steamrolled opposition from Democrats to pass a bill that slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy while giving mixed, temporary tax relief to middle-class Americans. The House approved the measure by 224-201, passing it for the second time in two days after a procedural foul-up forced another vote on Wednesday. The Republican-led Senate had passed it 51-48 in the early hours of Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe are making America great again,‚Äù Trump said, echoing his campaign slogan at a White House celebration with Republican lawmakers. ‚ÄúUltimately what does it mean? It means jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.‚Äù Trump, who emphasized a tax cut for middle-class Americans during his 2016 campaign, said at an earlier Cabinet meeting that lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent was ‚Äúprobably the biggest factor in this plan.‚Äù It was uncertain when the bill would be signed. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the timing depended on whether automatic spending cuts triggered by the legislation could be waived. The administration expects the waiver to be included in a spending resolution Congress will pass later this week, a White House official told reporters. Cohn told Fox News Channel on Wednesday night that Trump could sign the bill as soon as Friday if the resolution was passed by then. ‚ÄúIf not, most likely we‚Äôll sign it in the first week of the new year,‚Äù Cohn said. In addition to cutting the U.S. corporate income tax rate, the debt-financed legislation gives other business owners a new 20 percent deduction on business income and reshapes how the government taxes multinational corporations along the lines that the country‚Äôs largest businesses have recommended for years. Wall Street‚Äôs main indexes were little changed on Wednesday, taking a breather after a month-long rally ahead of the long-anticipated tax vote. The S&P 500 has climbed about 4.5 percent since mid-November, led by a rally in sectors such as transport, banks and others that are expected to benefit the most from lower taxes. Under the bill, millions of Americans would stop itemizing deductions, putting tax breaks that incentivize home ownership and charitable donations out of their reach, but also making tax returns somewhat simpler and shorter. The bill keeps the existing number of tax brackets but adjusts many of the rates and income levels for each one. The top tax rate for high earners is reduced. The estate tax on inheritances is changed so far fewer people will pay. Once signed, taxpayers likely would see the first changes to their paycheck tax withholdings in February. Most households will not see the full effect of the tax plan on their income until they file their 2018 taxes in early 2019. In two provisions added to secure needed Republican votes, the legislation also allows oil drilling in Alaska‚Äôs Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and removes a tax penalty under the Obamacare health law for Americans who do not obtain health insurance. ‚ÄúWe have essentially repealed Obamacare and we‚Äôll come up with something that will be much better,‚Äù Trump said. Democrats were united in opposition to the tax legislation, calling it a giveaway to the wealthy that will widen the income gap between rich and poor, while adding $1.5 trillion over the next decade to the $20 trillion national debt. Trump promised during the campaign that he would eliminate the national debt. ‚ÄúToday the Republicans take their victory lap for successfully pillaging the American middle class to benefit the powerful and the privileged,‚Äù House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said. Opinion polls show the tax bill is unpopular with the public and Democrats promised to make Republicans pay for their vote during next year‚Äôs congressional elections, when all 435 House seats and 34 of the 100 Senate seats will be up for grabs. ‚ÄúRepublicans will rue the day they passed this bill,‚Äù Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. ‚ÄúWe are going to continue hammering away about why this bill is so unpopular.‚Äù U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan defended the bill, saying support would grow for after it passes and Americans felt relief. ‚ÄúI think minds are going to change,‚Äù Ryan said on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù television program. A few Republicans, a party once defined by fiscal hawkishness, have protested the deficit spending encompassed in the bill. But most voted for it anyway, saying it would help businesses and individuals while boosting an already expanding economy they see as not growing fast enough. In the House, 12 Republicans voted against the tax bill. All but one, Walter Jones of North Carolina, were from the high-tax states of New York, New Jersey and California, which will be hit by the bill‚Äôs cap on deductions for state and local taxes. Despite Trump administration promises that the tax overhaul would focus on the middle class and not cut taxes for the rich, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, estimated middle-income households would see an average tax cut of $900 next year under the bill, while the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans would see an average cut of $51,000. The House was forced to vote again after the Senate parliamentarian ruled three minor provisions violated arcane Senate rules. To proceed, the Senate deleted the three provisions and then approved the bill. Since the House and Senate must approve the same legislation before Trump can sign it into law, the Senate‚Äôs vote sent the bill back to the House. ",REAL
Makluman Tarikh-Tarikh Peperiksaan SPM 2020 Adalah Palsu A59,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Passage of a long-anticipated U.S. tax overhaul has up-ended the bond market‚Äôs favorite trade of the year as yields on some long-dated Treasuries shot to their highest in months, but doubts that the tax cuts will fuel inflation have many investors confident the reversal will be short-lived. The view that the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep raising short-term interest rates, even as inflation remains subdued, has made longer-dated Treasury bonds more appealing to own than short-dated ones. This has made so-called yield curve flattener trades - a bet that the gap between short- and long-dated bond yields will narrow - a profitable bet in the bond market this year. Investors‚Äô appetite for this trade drove the yield curve to its flattest level in a decade earlier this week. However, a sharp reversal got underway as the tax bill‚Äôs passage became certain, paving the way for a bigger government deficit and more federal borrowing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great time to cash out,‚Äù said Brian Reynolds, asset class strategist at New York-based Canaccord Genuity.  Both Republican-controlled Congressional chambers have approved the tax legislation, and President Donald Trump is expected to sign it in the days ahead.    The Treasury market selloff pushed the benchmark 10-year yield up to nearly 2.50 percent, its highest in nine months and the 30-year yield to around 2.87 percent, a five-week peak. Some analysts reckoned the jump in yields reflects investors demanding higher compensation, or term premium, in case the tax cuts stoke inflation and hurt longer-dated bonds. How long this prevails is an open question, though, given previous episodes of curve steepening in the last year have quickly faded. ‚ÄúIn other words, sharp term premium moves tend not be permanent,‚Äù Cornerstone Macro analysts said in a note on Wednesday. In late afternoon trading, the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields was 63 basis points versus 60 basis points on Tuesday and around 51 earlier in the week. Even with this week‚Äôs steepening, the two-to-10-year part of the curve has flattened nearly 63 basis points this year. Curve flatteners are seen as likely to regain popularity in the long run due to a low inflation outlook and sturdy global demand for long-dated U.S. debt. In the short term, however, it may prove a choppy trade as investors gauge the bill‚Äôs impact. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to predict how the yield curve would behave in the short term. The biggest question is the timing and level of cash flows going to the government after tax reform,‚Äù Canaccord‚Äôs Reynolds said. One factor is the mountain of corporate cash held overseas. As part of the new tax code, U.S. multinational companies could bring back some of the estimated $2.6 trillion in business profits they have overseas and the Treasury Department could benefit from the taxes on the repatriated money.  Reynolds estimated the Treasury might receive as much as $225 billion in tax receipts in 2018 if the companies bring back all their overseas profits. This means the government could issue fewer two- and three-year Treasury securities, pressuring these yields lower and steepening the yield curve into 2019, he said.  Independent government estimates suggest the tax plan could add at least $1 trillion to the $20 trillion in national debt in 10 years as the Treasury Department would ratchet up borrowing to compensate for shortfalls in tax receipts. The degree to which the bill may spur both business investment and consumer spending, which could lift tax receipts and cap the rise in the deficit, is another key unknown for the shape of the yield curve going forward. Still, the dominant view on Wall Street remains that the cut will provide only a short-term bump up in economic growth, and many analysts expect the longer-term curve-flattening trend to reassert itself in the year ahead. ‚ÄúAccordingly, we maintain our conviction on curve flattening going into 2018,‚Äù Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday.

The month-long extension of the surveillance law, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, would punt a contentious national security issue into the new year in an attempt to buy lawmakers more time to hash out differences over various proposed privacy reforms.  Lawmakers leaving a Republican conference meeting on Wednesday evening said it was not clear whether the stop-gap bill had enough support to avert a partial government shutdown on Saturday, or whether the possible addition of the Section 702 extension would impact its chances for passage. It remained possible lawmakers would vote on the short-term extension separate from the spending bill. Absent congressional action the law, which allows the NSA to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States, will expire on Dec. 31.  Earlier in the day, House Republicans retreated from a plan to vote on a stand-alone measure to renew Section 702 until 2021 amid sizable opposition from both parties that stemmed from concerns the bill would violate U.S. privacy rights. Some U.S. officials have recently said that deadline may not ultimately matter and that the program can lawfully continue through April due to the way it is annually certified. But lawmakers and the White House still view the law‚Äôs end-year expiration as significant.  ‚ÄúI think clearly we need the reauthorization for FISA, and that is expected we‚Äôll get that done‚Äù before the end of the year, Marc Short, the White House‚Äôs legislative director, said Wednesday on MSNBC. U.S. intelligence officials consider Section 702 among the most vital of tools at their disposal to thwart threats to national security and American allies. The law allows the NSA to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States. But the program incidentally gathers communications of Americans for a variety of technical reasons, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas.

"Dakwaan Kerajaan Akan Keluarkan Lesen Operasi Kasino Di Forest City, Johor Adalah Tidak Benar ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, in a first exercise of his power to commute criminal sentences, cut short the 27-year prison term of a kosher meatpacking executive who was convicted eight years ago of bank fraud, the White House said on Wednesday. The commutation granted to Sholom Rubashkin, 57, marked only the second time that Trump has invoked his clemency authority as president, following the blanket pardon he granted earlier this year to Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona. Unlike the case of Arpaio, whom a judge had found guilty of contempt in a case involving racial profiling, Trump‚Äôs latest action leaves Rubashkin‚Äôs conviction intact, as well as terms of his supervised release from federal prison and his obligation to make restitution. Rubashkin was convicted in 2009 of 86 counts of financial fraud that came to light after a government raid on a kosher meatpacking plant in Postville, Iowa, where hundreds of undocumented immigrant workers were arrested. Rubashkin, a father of 10, was the chief executive overseeing the slaughterhouse and headquarters for a family business that was then the largest kosher meat-processing company in the United States.  The U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 refused to hear an appeal contesting Rubashkin‚Äôs sentence, which his lawyers argued was excessive for a first-time, non-violent offender. His lawyers also contended, to no avail, that he was entitled to a new trial based on evidence of alleged judicial misconduct. The case sparked an outcry from members of the legal and Orthodox Jewish communities who rallied to Rubashkin‚Äôs defense. The White House statement cited letters of support for review of Rubashkin‚Äôs case from more than 30 members of Congress of both parties, including House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and veteran Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.  Trump also pointed to bipartisan expressions of support for review of the case from over 100 former high-ranking U.S. Justice Department officials, prosecutors, judges and legal scholars. The White House further noted criticism of Rubashkin‚Äôs sentencing as unusually harsh in comparison to penalties imposed on others for similar white-collar crimes. Former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling was originally sentenced to 24 years in prison, but a federal judge later shortened his term of 14 years. The former CEO of Tyco International Ltd, L. Dennis Kozlowski, was sentenced to 8-1/3 to 25 years in prison and was paroled after serving eight. ",REAL

The U.S. government‚Äôs motion in federal court in Boston was in response to a judge‚Äôs order last month that found members of the group should be given time to make a case that changed conditions in the southeast Asian nation would make it dangerous for them to return. ‚ÄúEven if they are removed, petitioners‚Äô generalized evidence of Indonesia‚Äôs conditions do not prove that persecution or torture is immediate or likely for each petitioner,‚Äù the motion said. It said the court lacked jurisdiction over their claims, and the immigrants did not state any plausible claims.  The group of ethnic Chinese Christians fled the world‚Äôs largest Muslim-majority country following violence that erupted 20 years ago and have been living openly for years in New England under an informal deal reached with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Beginning in August, members of the group who showed up for ICE check-ins were told to prepare to leave the country, in keeping with U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration. Members of the group have said in interviews with Reuters that they entered the country on tourist visas but overstayed them and failed to seek asylum on time. Several said they fear they would face persecution or violence for their Christian faith and Chinese ethnicity if they were returned to Indonesia. Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts, and ICE contends that it has always had authority to deport members of the group. Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston last month found she had authority to ensure the Indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the United States. The Indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around the city of Dover, New Hampshire. Their cause has drawn the support of the state‚Äôs all-Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, and Republican Governor Chris Sununu. ",REAL

The 66-year-old former comedian from Minnesota had been seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, but faced growing calls from fellow Senate Democrats to step down as allegations against him mounted. Franken is one of several influential men who have lost their jobs after being accused of sexual misconduct, assault or harassment, including Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein and journalists Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose and Tavis Smiley. He will be the third lawmaker facing misconduct allegations to depart from Congress following Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks.

While Trump‚Äôs political allies have increased their criticism of Mueller, the president said on Sunday he was not considering firing him. Republican lawmakers have seized on anti-Trump texts by a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who was involved in the Russia investigation as evidence of bias in Mueller‚Äôs team. Mueller removed the agent from his team after the texts came to light. Republicans on several House of Representatives committees have also announced their own probes into long-standing political grievances, including the FBI‚Äôs handling of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Clinton, a Democrat, was Trump‚Äôs opponent in last year‚Äôs election. ‚ÄúOver the last several weeks, a growing chorus of irresponsible voices have called for President Trump to shut down Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation,‚Äù said Warner, adding that the attacks were ‚Äúseemingly coordinated.‚Äù ‚ÄúFiring Mr. Mueller or any other of the top brass involved in this investigation would not only call into question this administration‚Äôs commitment to the truth, but also to our most basic concept of rule of law,‚Äù Warner said. ‚ÄúIt also has the potential to provoke a constitutional crisis.‚Äù Warner called for Congress to make clear to the president that firing Mueller would have ‚Äúimmediate and significant consequences.‚Äù House Democrats had circulated rumors last week that Trump would fire Mueller this Friday, just before the Christmas holiday.

Dakwaan Tiada Penganjuran Majlis Tilawah Dan Hafazan Al-Quran Pada Tahun 2024,"(Reuters) - Democratic-leaning states may take legal action to challenge the cap on deductions of state and local taxes under the sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code, and even though such lawsuits would face long odds they could help galvanize Democrats for next year‚Äôs mid-term election. The U.S. tax bill, passed by Republicans in Congress on Wednesday, limits deductions of state and local income and property taxes, known as SALT, to $10,000. The provision hits hardest Democratic-leaning states with high incomes, high property values and high taxes, like New York, New Jersey and California.  Law professors said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states‚Äô rights under the U.S. Constitution. Some political strategists see a win for Democrats regardless of how courts ultimately rule, saying that lawsuits could be used to keep the issue front and center for voters already largely disenchanted with the Republican party. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a no-brainer for them to do this,‚Äù said Democratic political consultant Phil Singer. ‚ÄúFailing to aggressively pursue a remedy would be political malpractice.‚Äù New Jersey Governor-elect Phil Murphy said during an appearance on CNBC on Wednesday that ‚Äúeverything is on the table‚Äù for New Jersey to oppose the bill, including challenging its ‚Äúlegality and constitutionality.‚Äù  The governors of California and New York, Jerry Brown and Andrew Cuomo, have both previously said they were exploring legal challenges to SALT deduction limits. Their offices did not return requests for comment on Wednesday. Since President Donald Trump took office, blue states have aggressively used the courts to attempt to block the president‚Äôs agenda, suing over his proposed travel ban, environmental policies and other measures. William O‚ÄôReilly, a conservative political consultant in New York, said the SALT deduction issue would likely add to Republicans‚Äô ‚Äúsuburbia problem‚Äù among college-educated voters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. ‚ÄúThey already had one because of this president‚Äôs style,‚Äù O‚ÄôReilly said. Darien Shanske, a tax law professor at the University of California Davis School of Law, said the governors would probably argue that restricting the SALT deduction, which dates back to the introduction of the federal income tax in 1862, violates the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs 10th Amendment that protects states‚Äô rights. Shanske and other tax experts said the federalism argument would need to overcome the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs historically broad interpretations of Congress‚Äô 16th Amendment power to impose taxes. ‚ÄúAs a general matter, nothing prevents the federal government from changing the SALT deduction,‚Äù said David Gamage, a professor of tax law at Indiana University‚Äôs Maurer School of Law. In a frequently cited 1934 decision, the Supreme Court called tax deductions a ‚Äúlegislative grace‚Äù rather than a right, and said Congress has broad leeway to abolish them. The court reiterated this view in a 1988 decision allowing Congress to remove a federal tax exemption for interest on some state and local bonds.  Kirk Stark, a professor of tax law at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, said there is a slight possibility that a federalism argument against limiting the SALT deduction could gain traction. ‚ÄúCourts create new law all the time,‚Äù he said, noting that decisions on matters this sweeping tend to become political. But some legal experts noted that the state‚Äôs rights argument is more typically a conservative position. Using it to challenge the SALT provision could be a move that Democratic governors come to regret in the future, said Daniel Hemel, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.   ‚ÄúThe progressive agenda depends on the federal government being able to raise revenue and the Supreme Court not getting in the way of that,‚Äù Hemel said.

McConnell also said in a statement that he would offer the measure as a ‚Äúfree-standing vote,‚Äù without specifying when it would occur. Many supporters of the immigration initiative have argued that it would have the best prospects for passage if it was coupled with a must-pass bill such as a spending measure early next year that potentially increases military spending. The immigration measure would be designed to protect undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Democrats in Congress have been pressing for passage well before early March, when an Obama-era program is due to be completely phased out by the Trump administration. Earlier on Wednesday, Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake said in a statement that McConnell had promised to bring such a bill to the full Senate next month. Flake is one of a group of seven Democratic and Republican senators negotiating a bill. Former President Barack Obama‚Äôs Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals order temporarily protected around 800,000 Dreamers from deportation. President Donald Trump announced in September he was terminating the program but had asked Congress to devise a more permanent solution by March. A San Francisco federal judge on Wednesday wrestled with whether to order the government to keep DACA in place, while lawsuits challenging Trump‚Äôs decision unfold. At a hearing, U.S. District Judge William Alsup questioned whether he had the authority to review the decision to end DACA, but also said the administration‚Äôs justification for its move was brief and ‚Äúconclusory.‚Äù Alsup did not rule from the bench.  One of the plaintiffs, DACA recipient Dulce Garcia, attended the hearing and said she was in the sixth day of a hunger strike intended to urge lawmakers to make protection of DACA recipients a condition for passage of any more federal spending bills. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said in a statement, ‚ÄúBipartisan negotiations continue and we‚Äôre fighting to pass this measure soon.‚Äù He did not provide details on any progress being made in the talks.  A bipartisan group of senators led by Durbin and Republican Lindsey Graham have been holding private negotiations over how many Dreamers would be covered by legislation giving them temporary legal status and whether they would ultimately be allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship. The negotiations have been complicated by Republican demands that increased border security be included in any legislation. Republicans also have been clamoring for more immigration enforcement throughout the United States. Democrats have been opposed to that as part of a Dreamer measure, saying it is a way for the Trump administration to step up its deportations of undocumented relatives of Dreamers, thus breaking up families currently in the United States.

Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has said the provisions in a new tax bill passed by Congress could prompt drug and medical device manufacturers to leave the island territory, which is considered a foreign jurisdiction for tax purposes. ‚ÄúI personally do not think that this is going to hurt Puerto Rico,‚Äù the White House official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The tax base erosion provisions in the bill provide exemptions for the cost of goods U.S. companies buy offshore, meaning supplies made in Puerto Rico would not be affected, the White House official said. The manufacturing plants are an economic lifeline for 3.4 million Americans in the territory, where the economy never recovered after Congress in 2006 ended a different set of longstanding business tax breaks. Puerto Rico has $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt and near-insolvent public health systems, and filed the largest-ever U.S. government bankruptcy this year. Three months ago, Hurricane Maria slammed into the island, tearing up homes and the power grid and bringing its economy to a halt.

Isu Mykad Warga China Yang Tular Di Media Sosial Adalah Tidak,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The tax bill is President Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest legislative victory this year, but Democratic strategists are already planning how to turn it into his biggest liability. The emotional trigger they think will work on voters at next year‚Äôs midterm elections: arguing the bill is profoundly unfair by giving the lion‚Äôs share of benefits to corporations and the rich.   ‚ÄúBe careful what you wish for,‚Äù Tom Steyer, a Democratic billionaire, said of Republican leaders in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThey wanted this, they should have never have wanted it. Now that they‚Äôve got it, they‚Äôre going to wish they didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Steyer said he plans to use his money - through his political group NextGen America - to attack the Republican tax overhaul, using social media and online advertising aimed at young voters, a strategy that recently helped elect Democratic candidate Doug Jones in a Senate race in Alabama and Ralph Northam as governor of Virginia. In November 2018, elections will be held for all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and for 34 seats in the 100-member Senate.  Pollsters believe the midterms could be a rare ‚Äúwave election,‚Äù when one party seizes back control of Congress. It happened for Republicans in 2010 and 1994.  If Democrats are able to pick up two more Senate seats, they will take control of the chamber. And after the wins in Alabama and Virginia, they are even hopeful they could tap into anger over tax cuts for the rich to win control of the House. Only about 29 percent of voters approve of the tax bill, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in mid December. Slightly more than 52 percent oppose it. In no region of the country did even half of the people polled say they support it.  The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee is already running anti-tax plan ads in several key states including Nevada, Arizona, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  The ads are only five-second spots running before YouTube videos. The viewer, unable to skip over the ads, will hear: ‚ÄúThe Republican tax scheme gives huge breaks to corporations but raises taxes on middle class families.‚Äù The tax bill cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and raises the threshold at which an inheritance is taxed. It also cuts the tax rate for top earners.  While it also cuts the tax rate for most other income groups and doubles the size of the standard deduction, the elimination of other popular deductions could result in some taxpayers seeing a tax increase instead of a cut. It has been popular with the Republican base, Trump voters and the party‚Äôs donors. The stock market has surged in anticipation of the cuts.     Democrats plan to focus on provisions like benefits to commercial real estate owners, arguing that the tax bill could produce millions of dollars of more cash for Trump and his family members. The White House asserts Trump will not personally benefit ‚Äì but it admits that his business might.   The Super PAC American Bridge, which supports Democratic candidates, is running digital ads in states with Senate races targeting women, swing voters and Republicans in suburban areas, said Joshua Karp, the group‚Äôs communication director for Senate races.   ‚ÄúI think there is a couple of things that get almost all Americans riled up about this bill, it is fundamentally unfair and breaking the promise the Republicans made to the American people,‚Äù Karp said.  Republicans say Democrats are indulging in wishful thinking. Polls say 50 percent of voters think their taxes will go up, but tax analysts say that 80 percent will pay less tax.  Republicans are counting on voters, when they see more money in their paychecks, to dismiss Democratic rhetoric, and perhaps even throw their support behind Trump.  And if there are any unpleasant surprises in store for taxpayers, they will not be filing their first tax returns under the new law until early 2019, months after the midterm elections.  Republican strategist Alex Conant, a veteran of congressional and presidential campaigns, said the unpopularity of the tax cuts in opinion polls can be directly attributed to Trump‚Äôs low approval levels.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre losing elections because Donald Trump is incredibly unpopular and makes a lot of independents and soft Republicans uncomfortable ... Trump‚Äôs numbers are dragging down tax reform‚Äôs numbers,‚Äù Conant said, although he also played down the electoral risks of the tax overhaul. ‚ÄúI would be very surprised if people are marching in the streets months from now because we cut their taxes.‚Äù  Republicans have some other advantages, like the growing economy, that means an attack on the tax overhaul could backfire.  ‚ÄúDemocrats will have a very hard time taking this road if the economy is still going gang busters 11 months from now,‚Äù Republican strategist Joe Bretell said. But he acknowledges that the Democrats are on the right track.  ‚ÄúThe emotional trigger point is in fairness,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe party that can best explain or brand this bill and explain why it‚Äôs fair or unfair to their base or the other side, wins.‚Äù ",REAL

The results of a recount on Tuesday showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by one vote, enough to shift the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans. However, on Wednesday a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey, the Virginian-Pilot newspaper reported and Yancey confirmed. The two candidates in the 94th District, which includes Newport News in southeastern Virginia, are now tied at 11,608 votes. Under Virginia law, a tie in a House race should be decided by drawing lots, the equivalent of a coin toss or drawing straws, the Conference of State Legislatures said. ‚ÄúI am happy that every vote in Newport News was counted and that the judges took time to deliberate before rendering a decision,‚Äù Yancey said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúThis certainly is a historic election in our Commonwealth.‚Äù But Democrats slammed the decision, calling it erroneous and saying they were considering legal action to challenge it. Just Tuesday, Republicans conceded the seat, and Simonds, who made international news with what had appeared to be a narrow win, spent the morning Wednesday discussing the race on a variety of news shows.

Penjelasan Isu Discaj Penjawat Awam Dan Pesara Kerajaan Dari IJN ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, won a decades-long battle on Wednesday to open part of an Arctic wildlife reserve in her state to oil and gas drilling, but Democratic senators and conservationists vow the war has only begun.  The tax bill passed by Congress contains language pushed by Murkowski and supported by President Donald Trump to hold two lease sales in the 1.5 million-acre (600,000-hectare) 1002 area on the northern coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR.  Democrats and environmentalists deplore the prospect of development in ANWR, home to polar and grizzly bears, 200 species of birds, and where Gwich‚Äôin natives depend on migrating herds of porcupine caribou.  Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, said the fight over the drilling was not over. ‚ÄúIn fact I would say today is the beginning,‚Äù said Cantwell adding that Democrats would make sure the Trump administration follows all environmental laws before allowing drilling. Murkowski said ANWR oil would provide jobs, reduce U.S. imports of crude and help fill the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, a source of oil for the U.S. West Coast. The pipeline is now operating at a quarter of its capacity, after Alaskan production slumped in recent years.  Trump, expected to quickly sign the tax bill into law, said he had not been aware that fellow Republican politicians had long been trying to get at the oil in ANWR.  ‚ÄúA friend of mine who is in the oil business said: ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt believe it. ANWR. They‚Äôve been trying get it for 40 years,‚Äô‚Äù Trump said at the start of a Cabinet meeting. Trump said opening ANWR, a move supported by some members of the native I√±upiat tribe, would put the country, already the world‚Äôs top oil and natural gas producer, at a new level. But environmentalists said there were many stages, such as applications by companies to conduct seismic tests in the refuge, at which they could block drillers with lawsuits over endangered species and other environmental laws.  Suzanne Bostrom, a lawyer at Trustees for Alaska, a nonprofit environmental law firm, said opponents would scrutinize applications by energy companies for exploration, development, leasing and oil and gas production. ‚ÄúWe will be working every step of the way to make sure that the coastal plain is protected,‚Äù said Bostrom. The Interior Department will carry out environmental reviews of the lease sales, one to be held within four years and another within seven years, that opponents will track.  Environmental lawyers have had success in stopping drilling in the harsh and frigid Arctic. In 2015, Royal Dutch Shell ended a $7 billion quest to find oil offshore Alaska partly because environmental groups uncovered a little-known law that limited the number of drilling wells. Analysts at British bank Barclays said environmentalists could delay the lease sales and project approvals and ‚Äúmay discourage investment‚Äù entirely. Still, the bank said if new surveys show promising ANWR deposits, the region could attract producers that drill in frontier regions in Latin America and the Middle East. Senator Edward Markey, a longtime opponent of Arctic drilling, said the Republican tactic of including the drilling in a bill that only needed 50 votes in the Senate could backfire and help Democrats pick up seats in the 2018 congressional elections. Nobody knows how much oil the refuge contains, but the U.S. Geological Survey estimated in 1998 that the 1002 area held about 10.4 billion barrels of recoverable crude.  But a global oil glut that has kept domestic oil prices at levels below $60 a barrel may prevent wide success in ANWR. In a lease sale this month for land in Arctic Alaska, less than 1 percent of the 10.3 million acres (4.2 million hectares) received bids from oil companies.  ",REAL
Dakwaan Israel Bakal Jadikan Malaysia Sebagai Destinasi Pengecualian Visa Adalah Tidak,"(Reuters) - Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, is trying to win support from the Midwest corn lobby for a broad legislative overhaul of the nation‚Äôs biofuels policy, according to sources familiar with the matter. The effort comes as President Donald Trump‚Äôs White House mediates talks between the rival oil and corn industries over the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of corn-based ethanol and other biofuels in the nation‚Äôs fuel supply every year. Oil refiners say the regulation costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year and is threatening to put a handful of the nation‚Äôs refineries out of business. Ethanol interests have so far refused to budge on proposals to change it. Cornyn ‚Äúis working hard to unify all stakeholders in a consensus effort to reform the Renewable Fuel Standard,‚Äù an aide to the senator told Reuters. The aide, who asked not to be named, did not provide details. Cornyn, of Texas, the U.S. state that is home to the most oil refineries, is part of the Senate‚Äôs leadership team, responsible for securing the votes needed to pass the Republican party‚Äôs legislative agenda. Two lobbyists for the oil refining industry said Cornyn was having some success cobbling together a coalition of lawmakers and stakeholders around a potential RFS reform bill that could be dropped early next year. However, similar efforts to unify these rival factions have fallen flat in the past. Any such effort would need the buy-in of legislative backers of the ethanol industry, like Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, the top-producing state for corn. Officials for the senators did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Both Grassley and Ernst have previously repeatedly expressed their intention to defend the RFS in its current form. The White House has been hosting negotiations between both sides of the issue over short-term remedies that can provide relief to refiners struggling with the existing regulation. The refining industry says compliance now costs it hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and threatens to put some refineries out of business. Refineries that do not have adequate facilities to blend ethanol into their gasoline must purchase blending credits, called RINS, from rivals that do. RIN prices have risen in recent years as the amount of biofuels required under the RFS has increased. Refineries that buy RINs include Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Monroe Energy, both of Pennsylvania, and Valero Energy Corp of Texas. Valero said RINs cost it around $750 million last year, though there are competing arguments over whether refiners pass along those costs. Senator Ted Cruz, also of Texas, last week sent a proposal to the White House to cap the price of RINs at 10 cents each, a fraction of the current price. The proposal was widely rejected by the ethanol industry. The ethanol industry has said in the past that placing caps on the credits was a non-starter, and has instead argued for policies to increase volumes of ethanol in the U.S gasoline supply. The industry claims this would boost supplies of the credits, lowering their prices. Prices of renewable fuel credits have fallen in recent weeks on reports of the discussions in Washington. The price hit 68 cents on Wednesday, nearing a seven-month low, according to traders and Oil Price Information Services. The White House has not yet commented on Cruz‚Äôs proposal. The RFS was introduced by former President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions. It has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. The refining industry has pressed the Trump administration repeatedly to adopt reforms that would lower the credit costs or otherwise ease the burden on refineries, but the ethanol industry has successfully defeated those efforts so far.

Both are women, and on many policy issues it‚Äôs hard to tell them apart. Both even share the same first name - Stacey. But they sharply disagree on the path to victory.¬†¬†  Stacey Abrams, 44, wants to become the first African American female governor in the United States by mobilizing solidly Democratic black voters, who vote sporadically in elections, to form a winning coalition with white liberals. Stacey Evans, 39, thinks the math does not add up without¬†also appealing to white moderates, many of them outside urban areas, who voted for President Donald Trump last November. She is highlighting her crossover appeal as a white suburban mother with country roots. Their divergent strategies mirror a wider debate within the Democratic Party that has grown louder after strong turnout by minority voters helped to power recent Democratic victories in Alabama and Virginia. As the party prepares for the 2018 congressional elections, there is disagreement over which voters to spend more time and money on - minority voters who are a fast-growing share of the electorate but do not reliably cast ballots, or blue-collar and suburban whites who swing between parties. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2yYkcHV) Reuters interviews with liberal activist groups, some donors and an examination of campaign finance records show that many on the left are betting on Abrams‚Äô strategy as the best shot at turning a Republican state.  Underscoring the stakes in Georgia is the unusual attention from national groups seeking to push the party farther left. Their level of early support for Abrams is largely unparalleled among other 2018 gubernatorial and many congressional races. A dozen liberal groups have already thrown support behind Abrams, according to a Reuters tally, even though the Democratic primary, or nominating contest, is still months away. The breadth of that support has been little reported. Abrams, who rouses audiences to near religious fervor describing her struggles growing up poor and black in the South, argues that Democrats have wasted resources on swing voters.  ‚ÄúWe have left too many voters untouched,‚Äù she said in an interview, noting that she refuses to tone down her support for abortion, gay rights and labor unions to appeal to Republican-leaning voters.  Her opponent does not discount the importance of black voters and also embraces liberal views. But ‚Äúyou are going to have to persuade some moderate Republicans to vote for you, if you are going to win in Georgia,‚Äù said Evans, who tears up before crowds when she recounts a childhood spent moving from one rural trailer home to another. After losing the White House last year, the Democratic Party found itself powerless in Washington. Some in the party faulted their presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, for her lack of outreach to minority voters in key states. Others blamed her inability to connect with working class white voters who were once Democratic. Minorities supported the Democratic ticket by wide margins in 2016, but turnout was flat among Hispanics and sharply lower among African Americans, according to the Pew Research Center. Only half of Georgia‚Äôs black voters cast ballots in 2016, compared to more than two-thirds of whites, a Reuters review of state records showed. The Democratic National Committee said the recent wins in Alabama and Virginia ‚Äúshow that Democrats are a force to be reckoned with when we invest early in the communities that represent who we are as a Party.‚Äù  Jennifer Duffy, a political analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said boosting Democratic turnout could work as a strategy. But she urged caution - focusing too narrowly on specific demographic groups risks alienating moderate Democrats. And swing voters, especially in suburban areas, also played a role in the recent Democratic victories, she noted. University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock agreed the numbers are there if Democrats do not lose more white voters. ¬†¬†¬† At the Abrams campaign headquarters, a poster titled ‚ÄúHow We Win‚Äù points out that Democrats in Georgia have lost recent elections by some 200,000 votes. More than 1 million black voters did not cast ballots during the last governor‚Äôs race in 2014, state data shows.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt vote because we don‚Äôt ask, and this is a campaign that is going to keep asking,‚Äù Abrams said, speaking  on a recent evening to an audience of three dozen volunteers. ¬†¬†¬† Abrams, a tax attorney and romance novelist who led Democrats in the state legislature, said her campaign has already reached out to more than 300,000 voters with door knocks, phone calls and text messages.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†She hosted summer events with music and barbecue in a dozen smaller cities - places like Macon, a predominately African American community, and tiny Dalton in the rural northern state.  ¬†¬†¬† National liberal activists are lining up endorsements, money and manpower behind Abrams, who is seen as starting with an advantage in a Democratic primary dominated by black voters. Democracy for America, MoveOn Political Action and the Working Families Party call her campaign a model of how to engage the nation‚Äôs increasingly diverse electorate.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúPolitics is changing in America, and Abrams‚Äô path to victory reflects the changing demographics and enthusiasm,‚Äù said Dan Cantor, national chairman of the Working Families Party.  ¬†¬†¬† MoveOn, whose recent endorsement of Abrams marked its first in a 2018 governor‚Äôs race, said it would mobilize its 125,000 Georgia members as volunteers for her campaign.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†Democracy for America is similarly engaging nearly 35,000 members in the state. Officials said the group has already raised nearly $25,000 for Abrams, an unusually high sum for an election still a year away.  A group called PowerPac is organizing a $10 million get-out-the-vote effort with plans to hire people to contact minority voters and use targeted radio, phone and digital campaigns.  ¬†¬†¬† Individual donors from outside Georgia have contributed more than half of the $470,000 in larger donations that Abrams has reported, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records.¬†Billionaire George Soros, one of the Democratic Party‚Äôs biggest financial backers, and two sons donated $21,000 each. ¬†¬†¬† By contrast, Evans is not receiving many donations from outside of Georgia, nor national endorsements. Her campaign is focused on restoring cuts to a state college scholarship called HOPE. Most of her money has come from in-state donors, who have fueled almost all of her reported $390,000 in major donations. ¬†¬†¬† She has support from Georgia‚Äôs last Democratic governor, as well as a big-name Democratic strategist, Paul Begala, who worked for the governor who created the scholarship.  ¬†¬†¬†¬†The Georgia contest reflects divisions between those who want to broaden the Democratic electorate by bringing back voters who have shifted away, and those who want to drill deeper into the party‚Äôs base to increase turnout, said Begala, calling it ‚Äúan utterly false choice.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is like a football team saying, ‚ÄòDo you play offense, or defense?‚Äô‚Äù Begala said. ‚ÄúYou have to do both.‚Äù  ¬†¬†¬†¬†At a recent barbecue luncheon in Athens, Evans pointed out that she outperformed Clinton last year in her district by 12 percentage points, picking up moderate voters. ¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúYou can win in areas where you might not think you are going to have support, if you show up and talk to people,‚Äù she told lawyers lunching on pulled pork served on paper placemats. ¬†¬†¬† Evans is not knocking on voters‚Äô doors just yet. But she is traveling the state talking to local Democratic organizations and African-American churches.¬†¬†¬†  ¬†¬†¬†¬†Lukis Newborn, an undecided rural voter, recently heard Abrams speak in a suburban Atlanta sports bar. He found her exciting. But he also connects with Evans, having been raised in a household where dinner was rice and beans or peanut butter and jelly. ‚ÄúBoth are a part of me,‚Äù said Newborn, 26, from Paulding County. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an internal struggle of a Georgia Democrat like no other.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†  ",REAL
Waspada Tawaran Tunai Haji Menggunakan Visa Oleh Pihak Ketiga ," (Corrects spelling of Virginia House of Delegates member David Yancey throughout in this Dec. 19 story.) By Sharon Bernstein (Reuters) - Virginia Democrat Shelly Simonds won a seat in the House of Delegates by one vote, changing the power balance in the state legislature and extending a tide of Democratic victories beginning with November‚Äôs capture of the governorship and several legislative seats. Simonds beat incumbent David Yancey in a recount held Tuesday, both parties said in statements released after the unofficial vote recount was completed by officials in Newport News. ‚ÄúNever, ever forget how very much your vote counts,‚Äù House of Delegates member David Toscano said on Twitter, one of many Democrats rejoicing that a single vote handed them the seat. ‚ÄúI want to thank the voters who came out on Nov. 7,‚Äù Simonds said in a news release. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt have happened without their participation.‚Äù Republican leaders in the House of Delegates welcomed Simonds and thanked Yancey for his service, but the chairman of the state party vowed to fight on. ‚ÄúToday, our opponents carried the day,‚Äù Republican Party of Virginia Chairman John Whitbeck said in a statement emailed to Reuters. ‚ÄúTomorrow, we begin again.‚Äù Simonds‚Äô election, which still must be affirmed by a panel of three judges, means that the 100-member House of Delegates will have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.  That could lead to more moderate policies by forcing the parties to share power. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Republicans held 66 seats to Democrats‚Äô 34, along with a majority in the state senate, according to the election information website Ballotpedia. The GOP still holds a slim margin in the senate. Also on Nov. 7, the state elected Democrat Ralph Northam in a bitter race for governor, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump with a decisive victory over a Republican who had adopted some of the president‚Äôs combative tactics and issues. Democrats also picked up a hotly contested Senate seat in Alabama this month, after Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated Republican Roy Moore in a special election to replace former Senator Jeff Sessions, now President Trump‚Äôs Attorney General. Democratic Party activists hope their candidates can ride to victories in the 2018 Congressional elections on a wave of voter disenchantment with Trump and his Republicans.  Four legislative races, including the Simonds-Yancey battle in the 94th District, were slated for recounts. Going into the 94th District recount, Yancey was ahead by just 10 votes. On Tuesday, that changed, and Simonds clinched with a margin of one. ",REAL
Waspada Panggilan Palsu Menggunakan Nama Kementerian Komunikasi ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI‚ÄôS deputy director, Andrew McCabe, will appear for a closed-door interview on Thursday with two key U.S. congressional committees, after Republicans asked him to discuss the bureau‚Äôs handling of its Hillary Clinton email probe. The Justice Department confirmed in a letter on Wednesday to the chairmen of the House of Representatives Judiciary and Oversight committees that McCabe will sit for a transcribed interview, but said McCabe will not be permitted to discuss anything related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. It said the interview must be conducted in a classified setting and that the transcript should not be publicly released. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is part of the Justice Department. The Republican-led House Judiciary and Oversight committees announced in October they were launching fresh probes into a number of long-standing political grievances, including concerns over the FBI‚Äôs handling of the investigation of Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Republicans have said they want to get to the bottom of why former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump, publicly discussed the Clinton investigation and announced that the bureau would not seek to bring charges. Comey also publicly revealed, just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, that he was reopening the matter after the FBI discovered a new batch of Clinton emails. The case was closed shortly after the emails were reviewed, and no new information was uncovered. Critics say the Republicans‚Äô focus on Clinton is merely a tactic to distract from Mueller‚Äôs investigation and whether members of Trump‚Äôs campaign colluded with Russia. Since the new Clinton probe was announced, Republicans have also turned up the pressure on Mueller and attacked the FBI‚Äôs integrity, after anti-Trump text messages surfaced between two FBI employees who worked on Mueller‚Äôs team. One of the employees, agent Peter Strzok, was reassigned after the texts were discovered. The other, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, completed her temporary 45-day detail assignment with Mueller in mid-July.  Republican have also asked the Justice Department to make Page, who works in the FBI‚Äôs general counsel‚Äôs office, available for interviews. Trump has openly attacked the FBI, saying its reputation is in ‚Äútatters.‚Äù Russia has denied meddling in the election, and Trump has said there was no collusion. ",REAL

Surat Pembayaran SST Dari Kastam Meminta Penerima Membuat Pembayaran Adalah Tidak,"(Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval on Wednesday to a sweeping, debt-financed tax bill in a midday vote. It now will go to President Donald Trump to sign into law, although the timing of that was unclear. The Senate approved the bill early on Wednesday. Here are the key parts of the bill, representing the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years. CORPORATE TAX RATE: Cuts corporate income tax rate permanently to 21 percent from 35 percent, as of Jan. 1, 2018. PASS-THROUGHS: Creates a 20 percent deduction for the first $315,000 of qualified business income for joint filers of pass-through businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. For income above that threshold, the legislation phases in limits, producing an effective marginal tax rate of no more than 29.6 percent.   CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX: Repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax, set up to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some tax. TERRITORIAL SYSTEM: Exempts U.S. corporations from U.S. taxes on most future foreign profits, ending the present worldwide system of taxing profits of all U.S.-based corporations, no matter where they are earned. This would align the U.S. tax code with most other industrialized nations, undercut many offshore tax-dodging strategies and deliver to multinationals a goal they have pursued for years.  REPATRIATION: Sets a one-time mandatory tax of 8 percent on illiquid assets and 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents for about $2.6 trillion in U.S. business profits now held overseas. This foreign cash pile was created by a rule making foreign profits tax-deferred if they are not brought into the United States, or repatriated. That rule would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system. ANTI-BASE EROSION MEASURES: Prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad. Sets an alternative minimum tax on payments between U.S. corporations and foreign affiliates, and limits on shifting corporate income through transfers of intangible property, including patents. In combination, these measures with the repatriation and territorial system provisions, represent a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. tax system for multinationals. CAPITAL EXPENSING: Allows businesses to immediately write off, or expense, the full value of investments in new plant and equipment for five years, then gradually eliminates this 100 percent expensing over five years beginning in year six. Also makes changes to permit for more expensing by small businesses. INTEREST DEDUCTION LIMIT: Caps business deductions for debt interest payments at 30 percent of taxable income, regardless of deductions for depreciation, amortization or depletion.  CLEAN ENERGY: Preserves tax credits for producing electricity from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, municipal waste and hydropower. CARRIED INTEREST: Leaves in place ‚Äúcarried interest‚Äù loophole for private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers, despite pledges by Republicans including President Donald Trump to close it. These financiers can now claim a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year. A new rule would extend that holding period to three years, putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers but preserving its availability for many. BRACKETS: Maintains current seven tax brackets, but temporarily changes most income levels and rates for each one. For married couples filing jointly, effective Jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $19,050, versus 10 percent up to $18,650 under existing law; 12 percent on $19,051 to $77,400, versus 15 percent on$18,651 to $75,900; 22 percent on $77,401 to $165,000, versus 25 percent on $75,901 to $153,100; 24 percent on $165,001 to $315,000, versus 28 percent on $153,101 to $233,350; 32 percent on $315,001 to $400,000, versus 33 percent on $233,351 to $416,700; 35 percent on $400,001 to $600,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $470,700 37 percent above $600,000, versus 39.6 percent above$470,700. For single individuals, effective Jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $9,525, versus 10 percent up to $9,325 under existing law; 12 percent from $9,526 to $38,700, versus 15 percent on $9,326 to $37,950; 22 percent on $38,701 to $82,500, versus 25 percent on $37,951 to $91,900; 24 percent on $82,501 to $157,500, versus 28 percent on $91,901 to $191,650; 32 percent on $157,501 to $200,000, versus 33 percent on $191,651 to $416,700; 35 percent on $200,001 to $500,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $418,400; 37 percent above $500,000, versus 39.6 percent above $418,400. These brackets would expire after 2025. STANDARD DEDUCTION: In a change expected to end itemizing of deductions for millions of Americans, the bill for eight years beginning on Jan. 1, 2018, would increase the standard deduction - a fixed amount that can be subtracted from adjusted gross income to lower taxable income - to $12,000 from $6,350 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,700 for married couples. CHILD TAX CREDIT: Doubles the child tax credit to $2,000 per dependent child under age 17, with a refundable portion of $1,400. The refundable portion allows families to lower their tax bills to zero and receive a refund for the remaining value. PERSONAL EXEMPTION: Temporarily eliminates the $4,050 individual personal exemption. Under present law, taxpayers who earn below certain income caps can subtract this fixed dollar amount from their adjusted gross incomes to lower their taxable incomes. Generally, one exemption has been allowed per individual, spouse and child or other dependent. This would take effect Jan. 1, 2018, but then the personal exemption would return in 2026.  INDIVIDUAL ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX: Leaves the AMT in place but temporarily changes it by raising its exemptions and phase-outs. That will mean fewer people will have to pay the tax, while those who still do will take a smaller hit from it. INHERITANCES: Raises the exemption for estate and gift taxes to $10 million from $5 million per person and indexes the new exemption level for inflation after 2011. That means even fewer Americans would pay the estate tax, but it would stay on the books. MORTGAGES: For residences bought from Jan. 1, 2018, through Dec. 31, 2025, the bill caps the deduction for mortgage interest at $750,000 in home loan value. After Dec. 31, 2025, the cap would revert to $1 million in loan value. Suspends the deduction for interest on home equity loans from Jan. 1, 2018 until 2026. MEDICAL EXPENSES: Temporarily expands the deductibility of out-of-pocket medical expenses through 2019. OBAMACARE MANDATE: Repeals federal fine imposed on Americans under Obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage, a change expected to undermine the 2010 healthcare law. ANWR DRILLING: Allows oil drilling in Alaska‚Äôs Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ",REAL

Waspada Panggilan Yang Menyamar Sebagai Pegawai CyberSecurity Malaysia ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wealthy business owners, such as President Donald Trump, stand to gain from a provision in the Republican tax bill that creates a valuable deduction for owners of pass-through businesses, Democrats and some tax experts say. The provision creates a 20-percent business income deduction, with some limits, for sole proprietors and owners in partnerships and other non-corporate enterprises. It was initially sold by Republicans as a way to help small businesses and create jobs. But the final formula for determining what types of businesses can benefit has widened to take in companies with few, if any, workers, critics said. ‚ÄúThe president will try to tell the American people that his great political victory is a win for working people, but they see all the benefits going to his type of businesses: real estate pass-throughs,‚Äù Democratic Senator Jack Reed said on the Senate floor. Trump, a real estate developer, wants to sign the Republican tax bill into law this week, which would give Republicans their first major legislative victory of 2017. The House of Representatives and Senate were hurrying toward passage of the bill on Tuesday, with a final House vote set for Wednesday. On House Speaker Paul Ryan‚Äôs website, he said pass-through businesses employed about half of U.S. private-sector workers. High tax rates, he said, ‚Äúdiscourage investment and job creation, discourage business activity, and put American businesses at a competitive disadvantage.‚Äù Pass-through businesses‚Äô profits ‚Äúpass through‚Äù their books directly to owners, unlike corporations, which parcel out profits through dividends to stockholders. Under existing law, pass-through owners pay the individual income tax rate on those profits, not the corporate rate. Under the Republican bill, the corporate rate would be slashed to 21 percent, while the top individual income tax rate, which some pass-through business owners pay, would be 37 percent. To address the disparity, Republicans included tax relief for pass-through owners in their bill, allowing them to deduct 20 percent of their pass-through business income. Republicans put in anti-abuse measures to ensure owners of bona fide business operations claim the 20 percent deduction and prevent high earners from seeking to recategorize their income as pass-through income to take advantage of the deduction. Republicans also capped the income eligible for the full 20-percent deduction at $315,000 for married couples and $157,500 for individuals. But they included a ‚Äúcapital element‚Äù in the formula for determining eligibility beyond those thresholds, presenting a lucrative tax break for some, including wealthy owners of commercial property, said tax experts. ‚ÄúThis seems ideally suited for commercial property businesses, where there aren‚Äôt a lot of workers, but there is a lot of valuable property around,‚Äù said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a think tank. Income above the pass-through caps can be eligible for the 20-percent deduction based on a formula: 50 percent of employee wages paid; or 25 percent of wages plus 2.5 percent of the value of qualified property at purchase, whichever is greater. ‚ÄúThe idea is to use the sum of the ‚Äò2.5 percent rule‚Äô plus 25 percent of wages ... to get the full 20-percent deduction‚Äù on more income, said New York University School of Law Professor Daniel Shaviro, a tax law specialist, in an email. An assessment of the Republican bill by 13 tax experts, mostly academics, said the formula would ‚Äúexpand the ability of highly paid owners in certain industries ‚Äì and particularly those heavy in property but light in employees, like real estate ‚Äì to qualify for the pass-through deduction.‚Äù ",REAL
Surat Dengan Logo MKN Yang Digunakan Oleh Individu Warga Asing Untuk,"(Reuters) - The U.S. tax overhaul as currently proposed will make housing less affordable, according to nearly half of the property market experts polled by Reuters, with another third saying it would not do anything to improve it. A decade on from the start of the crash that knocked more than a third off U.S. home values and led to a deep global recession, the housing market has bounced back smartly. U.S. house prices are expected to rise next year and in 2019, faster than predicted just a few months ago and at more than double the rate of underlying consumer inflation and wages. That is in sharp contrast to the outlook for Britain. [GB/HOMES] The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of U.S. home prices in 20 metropolitan areas is expected to gain 5.1 percent next year and 4.2 percent in 2019. The main challenge currently is a chronic shortage of homes, which is pushing prices beyond the reach of new buyers, who tend to be young and not particularly well-paid and, if university-educated, already saddled with huge amounts of debt. Now adding to those concerns is an effort by President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration to overhaul the tax code, which analysts say could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market. The Republican tax proposal allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to $750,000, down from the current $1 million. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the tax bill on Tuesday afternoon, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would vote on Tuesday evening. Twelve of 26 analysts who answered an extra question said the tax bill in its current form will probably make housing more expensive. Eight respondents said it would do nothing and only six expected it would improve affordability. ‚ÄúLosing the tax deduction of mortgage payments and property taxes - of having deductibility limited - makes housing less attractive and less affordable,‚Äù said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics. But he added: ‚ÄúThe Trump/Congress plan is such a not-well-thought-out-mess it‚Äôs hard to tell how it will impact people in a systematic way.‚Äù Asked to rate affordability on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6. While the latest consensus on U.S. housing affordability has not changed in more than a year of polling, the range of forecasts has narrowed. ‚ÄúWe think there‚Äôs a possibility that if the tax bill is successful in generating economic growth, housing affordability could take a turn for the worse,‚Äù noted Ralph McLaughlin, economist at Trulia in San Francisco.  ‚ÄúThis is because the housing market has a supply, not a demand problem, so any policies that generate growth without boosting supply could make homes even more expensive than they already are.‚Äù Another challenge has been lingering for years. While the unemployment rate has plunged to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, annual wage growth has not broken above 2.9 percent since the Great Recession that ended about eight years ago. ‚ÄúHome prices have been appreciating circa 5-6 percent well above wage growth at 2-2.5 percent, decreasing affordability for the average buyer, particularly first-time homebuyers strapped with student loan debt and facing still modest labor market opportunities,‚Äù said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. She also pointed out that eliminating mortgage interest rate deductions will make housing less affordable.  The latest housing market data indicates that turnover is still far from the overheating boom rates from before the financial crisis. Existing home sales rose to a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of 5.48 million units in October, but well below the peak above 7 million units in 2005.  Property analysts now forecast annualized existing home sales in each quarter next year to average 5.5-5.6 million, less than the 5.70-million-unit pace hit in March, which was the highest since February 2007.  Those latest projections were also weaker than expected in a Reuters poll in August. But data on Monday showed U.S. single-family homebuilding and permits rose in November to a level not seen since August 2007 and confidence among homebuilders soaring to near an 18-1/2-year high in December, in a hopeful sign for a housing market that has been struggling with supply constraints. The U.S. Federal Reserve expects to raise interest rates three times next year. While lifting short-term rates won‚Äôt necessarily push up longer-term market rates, the path of least resistance is higher. Still, the latest Reuters consensus for mortgage rates was lower than what was forecast in the previous survey in August. The 30-year mortgage rate is expected to average 4.24 percent next year, rising to 4.65 percent in 2019 and 5.00 percent in 2020. Analysts were evenly split in the poll on whether a faster pace of rate hikes from the Fed would significantly slow activity.  ‚ÄúIf there are more than three hikes, it is likely that the Fed would be responding to stronger economic growth pushing inflation up ‚Äì and that stronger growth would offset the rise in rates,‚Äù said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio.

IPK Perlis Tidak Pernah Mengeluarkan Notis Seperti Yang Tular Di Media,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sweeping U.S. tax legislation appears to be on the verge of approval, lifting the prospects in particular for banks, telecoms, transports and other industries that stand to gain the most from lower corporate tax rates. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives hit a last-minute snag on Tuesday in their drive to approve the legislation favored by President Donald Trump. The plan on Capitol Hill was for the Senate to delete three offending provisions in the House version and vote on the bill, then send it back to the House for a vote on Wednesday. The bill slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. That would boost overall earnings for S&P 500 companies by 9.1 percent, according to UBS equity strategists. For an interactive graphic on how the bill ripples through industries: tmsnrt.rs/2kf26gx Momentum behind the tax bill over the past month has helped propel the stock market, which had already rallied sharply this year, to fresh record highs. The S&P 500 has climbed about 5 percent since mid-November when the House of Representatives passed its tax overhaul bill. But the bill, which also includes a one-time tax on profits held overseas and industry-specific measures, would benefit some stocks, industries and sectors more than others.  The industries that stand to benefit most from the lower rates are telecoms, transportation, retail and banks, analysts said. But for some groups, such as tech and healthcare, the impact is more mixed.  Domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services are poised to benefit from the lower tax rate. Hospital operator Universal Health Services Inc, lab-testing company Quest Diagnostics Inc and drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc are among the service companies set to benefit the most, according to Mizuho Securities. ‚ÄúWe believe tax reform should be a significant positive cash flow event, especially for healthcare services companies that tend to have limited international exposure and significant capital expenditures,‚Äù Mizuho analysts said in a research note. While many large drugmakers already report adjusted tax rates in the low 20 percent range, a number of companies would benefit from the ability to bring back overseas cash, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a recent note. According to Schott, Pfizer Inc, with $160 billion in offshore earnings, and Merck & Co Inc, with $70 billion, are particularly poised to gain from repatriating overseas funds. Banks are expected to be among the biggest winners from a lower tax rate. The S&P 500 banks index has soared 9 percent since mid-November as the tax bill began moving swiftly through Congress.     Of the major S&P sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates. Large U.S. banks will see an average 13 percent increase to earnings per share from the lower rate, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, with Wells Fargo & Co and PNC Financial Services Group having the biggest gains. Citizens Financial Group, Regions Financial Corp and M&T Bank Corp would see sizable earnings benefits and are also poised to be relative winners among large bank stocks, UBS analyst Saul Martinez said in a recent note. Banks could benefit indirectly if the tax bill provides an economic boost that spurs increased lending and higher interest rates. The technology sector, which had led the market‚Äôs rally for most of 2017, has underperformed the S&P 500 as the tax bill moved forward in Congress. Tech is expected to benefit less than most other sectors from a drop in the corporate rate, with an earnings boost of 5.3 percent, according to UBS. Semiconductors, whose shares have had a particularly rough ride in the past month, are expected to see earnings drop by 3.3 percent due to the overall bill, according to UBS. ‚ÄúMany chip companies have extensive international operations and relatively low blended tax rates,‚Äù Wells Fargo analysts said in a recent note. ‚ÄúWe see the possibility of changes in the U.S. tax rules as a potential risk for such companies.‚Äù One area where large tech companies could benefit is by spending cash held overseas for uses such as stock buybacks that boost earnings per share. UBS points to Cisco Systems Inc and Qualcomm Inc as companies that could see among the biggest buyback boosts. ‚ÄúThe tech sector would certainly be among the largest beneficiaries if cash stashed overseas can be repatriated at a low rate and presumably used for stock buybacks or dividends,‚Äù according to a recent note from Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research.

Waspada Taktik Sindiket Penipuan Melalui Pautan Palsu Bantuan Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight months into his lifetime U.S. Supreme Court appointment, Neil Gorsuch has given every indication through his votes in key cases and remarks from the bench he will be a stalwart of the conservative legal agenda, as President Donald Trump promised. Still early in his career as a justice that could span decades, Gorsuch has already established himself as among the most conservative members of the top U.S. court, and has not been shy about expressing his views, sometimes in idiosyncratic ways. He also has made public appearances before conservative audiences, including a speech at the Republican president‚Äôs Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington, that have drawn rebukes by liberal critics who questioned his independence from the president who nominated him. Gorsuch‚Äôs record so far suggests ‚Äúhe is going to be a reliably conservative vote,‚Äù said Carolyn Shapiro, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. Trump, who as a candidate promised to pick a justice in the mold of the late conservative icon Antonin Scalia, has set out to move the federal judiciary to the right. Gorsuch‚Äôs appointment has been his biggest step yet toward that goal, restoring the high court‚Äôs 5-4 conservative majority. Gorsuch‚Äôs April confirmation by the Republican-led Senate, despite strong Democratic opposition, provided one of Trump‚Äôs  biggest political victories since taking office in January.  Writing about Gorsuch on Twitter on Tuesday, Trump said he was ‚Äúvery proud of him and the job he is doing,‚Äù and rejected a Washington Post report that he had considered rescinding Gorsuch‚Äôs nomination this spring after the jurist said attacks on the judiciary like those that had been made by Trump were ‚Äúdisheartening‚Äù and ‚Äúdemoralizing.‚Äù  The newspaper reported that Trump had vented angrily to advisers that Gorsuch may not be sufficiently loyal. Trump responded that he had ‚Äúnever even wavered.‚Äù As the court rolls into 2018 with some big rulings ahead - on free speech, gay rights, voting rights and employee rights - legal experts said Trump will be able to rely on Gorsuch. The new justice has delivered key votes backing Trump‚Äôs travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries and on the death penalty, and embraced certain kinds of public funding for churches. During arguments this month in one of the court‚Äôs biggest cases of its current term, Gorsuch signaled sympathy for a conservative Christian baker who contends he was within his constitutional rights to refuse to create a wedding cake for a gay couple. Gorsuch declined an interview request for this article. Inside the Supreme Court chambers and outside it, Gorsuch, a 50-year-old Coloradoan, speaks his mind. ‚ÄúHe is not intimidated about being the newest justice,‚Äù said John Malcolm, a lawyer at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. Gorsuch has regularly sided with his fellow conservative justices. In the legal fight over the three versions of Trump‚Äôs travel ban, Gorsuch sided with the president on four different occasions. In June, he was one of three justices who would have let Trump‚Äôs second travel ban go into full effect. The court voted 6-3 to allow a limited version of the ban. On the death penalty, Gorsuch was among four conservative dissenters when the court in September granted a stay of execution for a Georgia inmate. In April, in his first recorded vote on the court, he was part of a 5-4 conservative majority that declined a stay of execution request from an Arkansas inmate. The court in 2018 is set to rule on two cases - one from Wisconsin and another from Maryland - involving the practice of drawing legislative districts in states in a way intended to entrench one party in power, known as partisan gerrymandering. The rulings could influence U.S. elections for decades. Based on the Oct. 3 oral argument in the Wisconsin case, in which Democratic voters challenged a Republican-drawn electoral map, it is unclear how the court will rule. Gorsuch used a culinary analogy to express his doubts during the argument about the Democratic challengers‚Äô legal theory. ‚ÄúIt reminds me a little bit of my steak rub,‚Äù Gorsuch said. ‚ÄúI like some turmeric, I like a few other little ingredients, but I‚Äôm not going to tell you how much of each. And so what‚Äôs this court supposed to do, a pinch of this, a pinch of that?‚Äù During a November speech hosted by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, Gorsuch confidently touted his judicial ideology, stressing the importance of interpreting the U.S. Constitution based on its original meaning and narrowly reading the text of laws passed by Congress. ‚ÄúTonight,‚Äù he said to sustained applause, ‚ÄúI can report, a person can be both a committed originalist and textualist and be confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States.‚Äù ",REAL
Waspada Laman Sesawang Meragukan Berkaitan Maklumat Dan Permohonan Bantuan Kerajaan ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican lawmakers told the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday that they want to question three senior FBI officials about an investigation of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state. The lawmakers, who are leading a joint probe into the Clinton investigation, said in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, that they wanted to speak with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI Chief of Staff Jim Rybicki and FBI counsel Lisa Page beginning on Thursday. The FBI declined to comment on the letter and referred reporters to the Justice Department. The request to meet the FBI officials for ‚Äútranscribed interviews‚Äù was made after Republicans obtained more than 300 text messages sent last year between Page and FBI agent Peter Strzok critical of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The text messages called him an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù and ‚Äúa loathsome human,‚Äù among other things, according to copies reviewed by Reuters. Strzok later worked for Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election and ties between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Moscow denies U.S. allegations of election meddling and Trump denies any campaign collusion.  Strzok, who helped lead the investigation of Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified material, was removed from Mueller‚Äôs team after the special counsel became aware of the texts critical of Trump. Republican lawmakers have attacked Mueller, expressing concern about potential bias among his investigators. But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has testified to lawmakers that  he was ‚Äúnot aware‚Äù of any impropriety by Mueller‚Äôs team. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Representative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, are conducting a joint review of the FBI‚Äôs handling of the Clinton investigation. In their letter to Sessions and Rosenstein, they said they were looking into several decisions by the FBI during the Clinton investigation, including then-FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs decision not refer Clinton‚Äôs case for prosecution.

Waspada Terhadap Iklan Pelaburan Di Media Sosial ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Near the end of President Donald Trump‚Äôs rocky first year in office, White House aides view imminent victory on a tax overhaul as a starting point to strengthen his weak approval ratings ahead of key congressional elections next November. Some Republicans said any effort at a political turnaround must include reining in Trump‚Äôs habit of lashing out at critics on Twitter. White House aides said they recognized that Trump‚Äôs poll numbers needed to start rising to limit the damage in 2018 elections in which his fellow Republicans‚Äô continued control of Congress will be at stake. A Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives and Senate could jeopardize Trump‚Äôs agenda. ‚ÄúWe have to grow, we have to move up, and I think having more successes like the tax vote will be important to us,‚Äù said a senior White House official. Administration officials said Trump would seek to use momentum generated from the biggest tax rewrite in 30 years to help propel other legislative priorities, including an infrastructure program and welfare reform. Final passage of the Republican tax bill is expected on Wednesday in what would be Trump‚Äôs first major legislative victory since taking office in January. But the tax bill carries risks. Republicans insist it will boost the economy and job growth. Democrats condemn it as a giveaway to corporations and the rich. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll, some 52 percent of adults said they opposed the tax plan, while 27 percent supported it. Unless Trump practices greater discipline, some Republican strategists see disaster looming in the congressional elections, in which a third of the 100-member Senate and all 435 seats in the House will be up for grabs. ‚ÄúStop tweeting and start the new year with a new level of message discipline. Just try it. It‚Äôll work. And you‚Äôll get those poll numbers back up,‚Äù said Republican strategist Scott Reed. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got to focus on that job approval number because it‚Äôs a historic death watch for midterm elections. The record is strong. His discipline is key for year two,‚Äù Reed said. Trump has repeatedly caused controversy with early morning tweets, particularly those aimed at individuals. He raised hackles recently when he tweeted that Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand ‚Äúwould do anything‚Äù for campaign donations. ‚ÄúThere are definitely moments that we‚Äôd all like to see stop,‚Äù one senior aide said. ‚ÄúSome of the early morning stuff has not been helpful over the last few weeks.‚Äù There has been some talk in the White House and among Trump‚Äôs outside advisers about hiring a senior political adviser akin to former President Barack Obama‚Äôs political aide David Axelrod or former President George W. Bush‚Äôs adviser Karl Rove. The White House political director, Bill Stepien, is seen as a more data-driven adviser. Trump, who sees himself as his own strategist, does not have anyone steeped in politics like his former White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, or former chief strategist Steve Bannon. Aides said there was some discussion of getting Trump into events with smaller settings in order to show a more personal side of the president. His standard appearance is to go to an event, deliver a speech to a big crowd and leave.    Trump is up against a historical trend in which the party that holds the White House typically loses seats in the first congressional elections after a president‚Äôs initial two years in office.  Democratic President Bill Clinton had a 46 percent approval rating in November 1994 and his party still lost 54 seats in the House and eight in the Senate. Trump was at 41 percent in a mid-December poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. Republican strategist Ford O‚ÄôConnell said Trump had done much to keep his conservative base of support happy but had to expand his popularity. To do that, he needs to ease voters‚Äô concerns about his fitness for office. ‚ÄúWhat he has to do to win over people like independents and never-Trumpers is make the American people feel comfortable with him as president,‚Äù said O‚ÄôConnell. ‚ÄúHis achievements are quite striking, but he‚Äôs just not connecting (with the public).‚Äù ",REAL

In a week when President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress are hoping to celebrate the passage of tax overhaul legislation, many in the party showed little appetite for a government shutdown at week‚Äôs end. But they sounded resigned to having to navigate through some drama over a package that includes so many disparate components, which could make for a messy process. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to vote for whatever I need to, to keep the government open,‚Äù Republican Representative Chris Collins told reporters. The last time government agencies had to shut down because Washington could not pay its bills was in October 2013. Leading Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives expressed optimism that a funding bill, coupled with a large new disaster aid package, would pass by Friday‚Äôs deadline. But some were predicting that lawmakers would bump right up against the cutoff. The House could vote as soon as Wednesday on legislation that extends most funding for domestic programs through Jan. 19. Democrats are likely to mainly oppose the bill, arguing that their priorities are being ignored. Conservative Republicans are insisting on higher military funding through the rest of the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30 as part of the House bill. Democrats in the Senate are expected to block that formula if, as expected, it does not also have more money for non-defense programs. The House measure would also include $81 billion in disaster funding to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several U.S. states recover from hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters. That price tag has made some Republicans uneasy. Some Republicans are also worried about a Senate strategy to add a bipartisan healthcare proposal to the government funding bill, in keeping with a promise Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made in order to coax Republican Senator Susan Collins to vote for the tax legislation. Conservative House Republicans do not like the bipartisan healthcare proposal because it would fund subsidies for low-income participants in the Obamacare health insurance program, and does not include language that restricts federal funds for abortion. McConnell‚Äôs promise to Collins ‚Äúmeans squat over here,‚Äù said Representative Mark Walker, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest group of conservatives in the House. Some conservatives may vote against the funding bill in protest, he told reporters outside the House. The House bill also would extend the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program for five years. If Democrats continue to withhold their support for the stopgap spending bill and some Republicans peel off, Congress could find itself struggling to pass a bill as the clock ticks toward midnight on Friday.

Republicans control the House of Representatives and Senate, but disagreements between the two chambers, along with differences between Republicans and Democrats, make for potentially difficult days ahead. The following are the big initiatives under consideration: Money expires at midnight on Friday for the operation of most federal agencies. That is because Congress has failed to approve the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1 and Washington has been operating on a series of temporary funding bills. The House is proposing another temporary extension - one that would run through Jan. 19, 2018. It is unclear whether the Senate would stick with that date or seek a slightly later one to give Congress more time to write legislation funding agencies through Sept. 30. President Donald Trump is pushing for a significant increase in defense spending. Conservatives in Congress want to include that money in the stopgap funding bill this week. But Senate Democrats are expected to block it until negotiators can reach a deal on coupling more non-defense spending with a bigger military budget. Congress is likely to include $81 billion to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states recover from severe hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters. The Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program, which helps provide medical care to nearly 9 million children in low-income families, is slated for a five-year renewal by the House. But the Senate might balk at the way it is structured. It was unclear whether it would opt for temporary funding. The Senate might attach a bipartisan measure that maintains healthcare subsidies for low-income people participating in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Many House Republican lawmakers dislike that idea. The National Security Agency‚Äôs warrantless internet surveillance program under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act could be renewed, but there are competing versions of such legislation in the House and Senate.  Legislation to protect ‚ÄúDreamers‚Äù from deportation is not expected to be included, despite Democrats‚Äô push to resolve the issue by year‚Äôs end. Negotiators are trying to reach a deal on helping the immigrants, many from Mexico and Central America, who were brought to the United States illegally as children.

The committee voted 13-10 against Scott Garrett as EXIM president in a rebuke to conservatives who saw the former New Jersey Republican congressman as an ally who would keep tight controls on the government export lender.  Garrett helped lead a 2015 effort to shut down EXIM to end a source of ‚Äúcorporate welfare‚Äù for giant manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric. After his nomination he pledged to keep the bank ‚Äúfully open‚Äù but struggled to persuade senators that he now believed in the bank‚Äôs core mission of providing taxpayer-backed loans and guarantees for U.S. export transactions. ‚ÄúI believe he‚Äôs a principled man who simply believes in the abolishment of the bank,‚Äù said Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who voted against Garrett along with South Carolina Republican Tim Scott and all Democrats on the panel. The White House‚Äôs director of legislative affairs, Marc Short, commented, ‚ÄúWe are disappointed that the Senate Banking Committee missed this opportunity to get the Export Import Bank fully functioning again. We will continue to work with the committee on a path forward.‚Äù  The committee, however, approved Trump‚Äôs nominations for EXIM‚Äôs first vice president, Kimberly Reed, and three other board members: former Louisiana congressman Spencer Bachus, Claudia Slacik and Judith DelZoppo Pryor. It also approved Mark Greenblatt as the agency‚Äôs inspector general. Confirmation of at least three board members will allow EXIM to resume approval of loans and guarantees above $10 million, returning the United States to export financing for major projects such as commercial aircraft, power turbines and  petrochemical plants for the first time since June 2015.  GE in a statement urged quick confirmation of the remaining EXIM nominees and hailed the committee vote as ‚Äúa milestone for manufacturers across the U.S. whose customers require a fully-functioning EXIM Bank.‚Äù EXIM has a $42 billion backlog of deals in its pipeline awaiting approval, representing about 250,000 U.S. jobs based on Bureau of Labor Statistics multiplier data, said Scott Schloegel, an Obama administration appointee who still serves as the bank‚Äôs top officer.

From 2008 through 2012, the employment office for Congress paid more than $166,000 in public money to settle eight claims against lawmakers alleging sexual harassment or discrimination, according to data it provided on Tuesday to Representative Gregg Harper, the Republican chairman of the House Administration Committee who is drafting a bill to overhaul how Congress handles sexual harassment. The Office of Compliance previously said it has resolved three other cases since 2013. Provisions in settlement agreements and other legal limits block the office from disclosing details of the payouts it has made on behalf of lawmakers, including identities of those involved, an issue that has come to light as allegations of misconduct swirl around Capitol Hill.  A growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men recently, from movie producer Harvey Weinstein to popular television personality Matt Lauer, as well as one of the longest-serving Democrats in Congress, former Representative John Conyers.  Harper said on Tuesday he hopes to file a bipartisan bill by Wednesday evening overhauling how Congress handles sexual harassment that would include making lawmakers personally liable for settlements. ‚ÄúThey should have to reimburse‚Äù the government for payouts, he told reporters. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no doubt that members have made it clear that taxpayer dollars should not be used for the purposes of settling a sexual harassment claim.‚Äù Harper expects swift action, with the House voting on the bill next month. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier, who has proposed similar legislation and has been working with Harper and other Republicans, said she was ‚Äúthrilled‚Äù about the bill.  Bipartisan legislation on sexual harassment was introduced in the Senate last week. In a letter to Harper the compliance office‚Äôs executive director said it had paid $354,465.85 to settle 16 total claims of employment discrimination, retaliation and harassment from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2012. According to the letter, eight claims included sexual  harassment or discrimination, and often involved other violations such as breaking federal wage rules. Two claims were simply categorized as ‚Äúretaliation‚Äù while the rest were focused on racial, age or disability discrimination.

Penjelasan Berkenaan Pengecualian Cecair Atau Gel Mengandungi Nikotin Dari Akta Racun,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of nearly 20 environmental and Native American tribal groups sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, challenging its delay of a rule limiting emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas drilling operations on federal lands. Earlier this month, the Bureau of Land Management, part of the Department of the Interior, suspended implementation of the rule for a year, until Jan. 17, 2019, saying it wanted to avoid compliance costs for energy companies as it revises the regulation. The delay ‚Äúis yet another action taken by the Trump administration to benefit the oil and gas industry at the expense of the American public, particularly the millions of Westerners‚Äù who use public lands for ranching, hunting, hiking and other purposes, Darin Schroeder, a lawyer with the Clean Air Task Force, said in a statement. His organization represented the National Wildlife Federation, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit against Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his department. Energy companies say the rule, finalized at the end of the Obama administration in 2016, could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well.  The Trump administration is expected to announce a new draft rule in coming weeks, in line with its policy of maximizing output of oil, gas and coal and dismantling regulations it says prevent job growth.  The rule targets accidental leaks and intentional venting of methane from drilling operations on public lands, where about 9 percent of the country‚Äôs natural gas and 5 percent of its oil were produced last fiscal year. Some of its 2017 provisions have already been phased in, but the majority of them have yet to go into effect. The lawsuit, also filed by the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Council, and the Din√© Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment, a Navajo group, seeks to stop the delay and force the Interior Department to implement the rule in January. It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco.  The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. ",REAL

Mesej Boleh Mendapatkan Vaksinasi Tanpa Janji Temu MySejahtera Di PPV Offsite,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress appeared all but certain to pass sweeping tax legislation this week after two Senate Republican holdouts agreed on Monday to support a tax overhaul backed by President Donald Trump.   As the Republicans‚Äô self-imposed Friday voting deadline loomed, Senators Susan Collins and Mike Lee each said they had decided to back the legislation hammered out last week among Republicans from the Senate and House of Representatives.  ‚ÄúThe first major overhaul of our tax code since 1986, this legislation will provide tax relief to working families, encourage the creation of jobs right here in America and spur economic growth that will benefit all Americans,‚Äù Collins said on the floor of the Senate while announcing her support. The Maine Republican had been undecided on the legislation.  Lee had been similarly undecided until the Utah Republican tweeted earlier in the day that he would ‚Äúproudly‚Äù vote for the bill.   The House of Representatives, which is also expected to adopt the bill, was due to vote first at around 1:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) on Tuesday, Republican aides said. The Senate vote is expected to follow either later on Tuesday or on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe will get it on the president‚Äôs desk for him to sign into law before Christmas, as we pledged,‚Äù predicted No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn, who said the Senate would begin 10 hours of debate after receiving the House-approved measure. White House officials said on Monday that Vice President Mike Pence, who would cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate if necessary, was delaying his trip to Egypt and Israel this week to be in Washington for the vote on the tax plan. ‚ÄúThe tax vote is still in very good shape, but we don‚Äôt want to take any chances,‚Äù a White House official said. The package of tax cuts for businesses and individuals, if enacted, would overhaul the U.S. tax code for the first time in more than 30 years and give Republicans their first major legislative victory of Trump‚Äôs presidency. Republicans, who believe they must act to preserve their House and Senate majorities in next year‚Äôs congressional elections, insist the tax cuts will drive U.S. economic growth higher and create jobs. Democrats, who oppose it, describe the legislation as a giveaway to corporations and wealthy Americans that will add $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade while raising taxes on some middle-class taxpayers.   Lawmakers in the House, where Republicans hold a 239-193 seat majority, are expected to approve the legislation largely along party lines. A smattering of ‚Äúno‚Äù votes is likely from Republican fiscal hawks and lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California who oppose a provision that would scale back a popular deduction for state and local taxes.   Both the House and Senate must approve the measure before Trump can sign it into law. The 100-seat Senate, where Republicans have only a 52-48 majority, proved to be the graveyard for last summer‚Äôs Republican drive to overturn former Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs healthcare law, when three Republicans opposed the measure. The tax overhaul has also faced challenges. But the specter of failure appeared to lift on Monday, as Congress closed in on final votes. Senate Republicans can afford to lose no more than two votes if they intend to pass tax legislation, and they are already down one vote. Senator John McCain, who is undergoing treatment for brain cancer, will not be available to support the bill because he is spending time with family in Arizona.   With support from Collins and Lee, only Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona remained undecided. A fifth Republican, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, has missed votes for health reasons this year but was expected to be on hand to support the tax bill. Republican Senator Bob Corker, a fiscal hawk, voted against the initial Senate bill but has said he will support final legislation. ",REAL
Kekecohan Membabitkan Sekumpulan Penjaja Dengan Anggota Penguatkuasa MDS Adalah Video Lama ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court judge ruled on Monday that President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration must allow access to abortion for two pregnant teenagers who are in the country illegally, escalating a high-profile legal fight. Judge Tanya Chutkan put her order on hold, however, to give the U.S. Justice Department time to appeal her ruling.  The Justice Department filed its notice of appeal shortly afterward to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The judge‚Äôs temporary restraining order marked the latest chapter in a legal dispute with the Trump administration over whether minors who are illegal immigrants have the right to seek an abortion during their detention. The issue was ignited by a 17-year-old who petitioned the court in October to have an abortion, and ultimately had the procedure over the Trump administration‚Äôs objections.  In that instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on Oct. 24 that the teen could have an abortion immediately, rejecting the administration‚Äôs opposition. The two 17-year-olds in the latest legal action, known to the court as Jane Roe and Jane Poe, requested abortions, but the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement has refused to allow them access to the procedure. In her ruling, Chutkan wrote that the girls‚Äô  ‚Äúconstitutional right to decide whether to carry their pregnancies to term‚Äù needed to be preserved.  She also noted they were likely to succeed on the legal merits of their case, based on the prior ruling in the higher court. ‚ÄúWe are deeply disappointed in the decision to grant a temporary restraining order that will compel HHS to facilitate abortions for minors when they are not medically necessary,‚Äù a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. ‚ÄúA pregnant minor who has entered the country illegally has the option to voluntarily depart to her home country or identify a suitable sponsor.¬†HHS-funded facilities that provide temporary shelter and care for unaccompanied alien minors should not become way stations for these children to get taxpayer-facilitated abortions.‚Äù  ",REAL

The legislation would help Puerto Rico and several states recover from devastating hurricanes and California and other Western states cope with wildfires. It was unclear whether the latest natural-disaster aid plan would be rushed through the Republican-controlled Congress this week, before the start of a Christmas recess, or await congressional votes early next year. The bill, introduced by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, includes $27.6 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and $26.1 billion for community development block grants.  ‚ÄúWe have a commitment to our fellow citizens that are in the midst of major rebuilding efforts in all areas, including Texas, Florida, California, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,‚Äù Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican, said in a statement.     Earlier this year, Congress approved two disaster aid packages totaling about $52 billion. Trump‚Äôs $44 billion request submitted in mid-November was widely criticized by lawmakers as being insufficient. About a third of Puerto Rico‚Äôs residents are still without power and hundreds remain in shelters three months after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.

Dakwaan Terdapat Peraturan Komunikasi Baharu Oleh Kerajaan Adalah Tidak Benar ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he plans to nominate Liberty University School of Law professor Caren Harp to oversee the Justice Department‚Äôs Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. If ultimately confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Harp would oversee the Justice Department office that trains and works with state and local communities to develop effective juvenile justice programs and prevent delinquency. Harp previously was director of the National Juvenile Justice Prosecution Center at the American Prosecutors Research Institute.  According to Harp‚Äôs LinkedIn page, she is in her sixth year as a professor at Liberty, which is located in Lynchburg, Virginia. The law school‚Äôs website says its program is ‚Äútaught from a Christian worldview‚Äù and says it offers a ‚Äúuniquely tailored legal program taught with sound biblical principles.‚Äù Harp, who holds a law degree from the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville, has also worked as both a prosecutor and a public defender, including as chief of the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit in New York City, Family Court Division, and as a trial attorney for the Arkansas Public Defender Commission.  In an article published in May, Harp raises questions about the role of adolescent neuroscience in the courtroom and writes that the best way to tackle juvenile justice is by teaching youth to accept responsibility and involve them in community-based diversion programs to prevent them from re-offending.      ‚ÄúMisplaced reliance on nascent neuroscience and neuroimaging evidence to remove from youth and young adults the consequences of their criminal behavior invites pushback from those who favor a retributive system, and it may create some unintended and unwanted consequences for youth and young adults,‚Äù she writes. It is unclear when the Senate may consider Harp‚Äôs nomination. There are a handful of key nominees who have been waiting months now for their confirmation votes. Nominees to head the Criminal, Civil and National Security divisions, for instance, are still pending. ",REAL

Dakwaan Bahawa Starbucks Telah Disahkan Haram Oleh JAKIM Adalah Tidak Benar ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two members of President Donald Trump‚Äôs Cabinet are set to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday to assess the U.S. territory‚Äôs rebuilding in the three months since Hurricane Maria devastated homes, businesses and the power grid. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson will travel to Puerto Rico, where about a third of the island‚Äôs 3.4 million residents are still without power, hundreds remain in shelters, and thousands have fled to the U.S. mainland. The visit comes as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday were planning to unveil a disaster aid package totaling $81 billion, according to a senior congressional aide. Some of that aid would go to Puerto Rico, but also to states like Texas and Florida that were hit by other hurricanes and to California, which is grappling with wild fires. Even before Maria savaged Puerto Rico, the island was contending with $72 billion in debt. Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello has asked the federal government for a total of $94.4 billion in aid, including $31.1 billion for housing and $17.8 billion to rebuild its ruined power grid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has so far approved more than $660 million in aid for individuals in Puerto Rico as well as more than $450 million in public assistance. Nielsen and Carson will receive detailed briefings on rebuilding efforts and see how federal aid is helping residents to recover, a DHS official said. Nielsen, who oversees FEMA, and Rossello are slated to hold a news conference. The visit comes as Congress prepares to vote on a tax overhaul bill that Puerto Rican officials have said they fear will hurt the commonwealth‚Äôs pharmaceutical manufacturing sector - the cornerstone of the island‚Äôs economy - at a time when Puerto Rico can least afford to lose jobs and tax revenue. Puerto Rico‚Äôs government has said 64 people died because of the hurricane, but after multiple media estimates of dramatically higher figures, Rossello on Monday ordered an official review of the death toll.
